    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s the liner
      steamed into Callao Roads, and long before it had anchored, it was
      surrounded by a flotilla of small boats. A moment later, deck, saloons and
      cabins were invaded by a host of gesticulating and strong-minded boatmen,
      whose badges attested that they were duly licensed to carry off what
      passengers and luggage they could. They raged impotently, however, round
      Francis Montgomery, F.R.S., who sat enthroned on a pile of securely locked
      boxes in which were stored his cherished manuscripts and books.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that they told him it would be two full hours before the
      ship came alongside the Darsena dock. Nothing would part him from his
      treasures, nothing induce him to allow these half-crazed foreigners to
      hurl his precious luggage overside into those frail-looking skiffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this was suggested to him by a tall young man who called him uncle,
      the irascible scientist explained with fluency and point that the idea was
      an utterly ridiculous one. So Dick Montgomery shrugged his broad
      shoulders, and with a &ldquo;See you presently,&rdquo; that hardly interrupted his
      uncle&rsquo;s flow of words, beckoned to a boatman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he had left the ship&rsquo;s side and was nearing the shore&mdash;the
      Eldorado of his young ambition, the land of gold and legends, the Peru of
      Pizarro and the Incas. Then the thought of a young girl&rsquo;s face blotted out
      those dreams to make way for new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monotonous outline of the waterfront brought no disappointment. Little
      did he care that the city stretched out there before his eyes was little
      more than a narrow, unbeautiful blur along the sea coast, that there were
      none of those towers, steeples or minarets with which our ancient ports
      beckon out to sea that the traveler is welcome. Even when his boat had
      passed the Mole, and they drew level with the modern works of the Muelle
      Darsena, well calculated to excite the interest of a younger engineer, he
      remained indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had asked the boatman where the Calle de Lima lay, and his eyes hardly
      left the part of the city which had been pointed out to him in reply. At
      the landing stage he threw a hand-full of centavos to his man, and
      shouldered his way through the press of guides, interpreters, hotel touts
      and other waterside parasites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he was before the Calle de Lima, a thoroughfare which seemed to be
      the boundary line between the old city and the new. Above, to the east,
      was the business section&mdash;streets broad or narrow fronted with big,
      modern buildings that were the homes of English, French, German, Italian
      and Spanish firms without number. Below, to the west, a network of
      tortuous rows and alleys, full of color, with colonnades and verandahs
      encroaching on every available space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick plunged into this labyrinth, shouldered by muscular Chinamen carrying
      huge loads, and by lazy Indians. Here and there was to be seen a sailor
      leaving or entering one of the many cafés which opened their doors into
      the cool bustle of the narrow streets. Though it was his first visit to
      Callao, the young man hardly hesitated in his way. Then he stopped short
      against a decrepit old wall close to a verandah from which came the sound
      of a fresh young voice, young but very assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you like, señor,&rdquo; it said in Spanish. &ldquo;But at that price your
      fertilizer can only be of an inferior quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes the argument went on within. Then there was an exchange
      of courteous farewells and a door was closed. Dick approached the balcony
      and looked into the room. Seated before an enormous ledger was a young
      girl, busily engaged in transcribing figures into a little note-book
      attached by a gold chain to the daintiest of waists. Her face, a
      strikingly beautiful one, was a little set under its crown of coal-black
      hair as she bent over her task. It was not the head of a languorous
      Southern belle&mdash;rather the curls of Carmen helmeting a blue-eyed
      Minerva, a little goddess of reason of today and a thorough
      business-woman. At last she lifted her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy green ledger slipped and crashed to the floor, as she ran toward
      him both hands outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and how is business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, so.... And how are you?... But we did not expect you till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We made rather a good passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is May?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very grown-up person now. I suppose you&rsquo;ve heard? Her second baby
      was born just before we left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dear smoky old London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was raining hard when last I saw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is your uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still on board. He won&rsquo;t leave his collection.... Does nothing all day
      but take notes for his next book.... Wait a minute, I&rsquo;ll come in. Where&rsquo;s
      the door? I suppose it would be bad form to climb in through the window?
      Won&rsquo;t I be in the way, though? You seem awfully busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, but you may come in. Round the corner there, and the first door on
      your right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her indications and found an archway leading into a huge
      courtyard crowded with Chinese coolies and Quichua Indians. A huge dray,
      coming from the direction of the harbor, rumbled under the archway, and
      wheeled in the court to let an empty one pass out. People and things
      seemed to unite in making as much dust and noise as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she manages all this,&rdquo; he reflected as he made his way toward a door
      at which she had appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may kiss me,&rdquo; she said as she closed the door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her in his arms and held her to him, by far the more troubled of
      the two. Again it was she who spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you really have not forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you believe it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you were so long in coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wrote, and...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind now. It is not too late. I have just refused my fourth
      suitor, Don Alonso de Cuelar. And father, I think, is furious with me for
      refusing the most eligible young man in Lima.... Well, why don&rsquo;t you say
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, dear.... How is your father? and the kiddies?... I hardly
      know what I am saying, I am so glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father is very well, and very glad to hear that you were coming. To tell
      the truth though, he is far more interested in your uncle&rsquo;s visit. He has
      arranged a meeting at the Geographical Society for him. And for the past
      month he has been thinking and talking of nothing but archaeology. They
      have been digging up all sorts of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so he has been angry with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to think he has every reason to be. I am twenty-three and he
      already sees me an old maid.... It&rsquo;s awfully funny! Do you know what they
      call me in Lima now? The Virgin of the Sun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Agnes and Aunt Irene will explain better than I can. It&rsquo;s something
      like one of the Vestals&mdash;an old Inca legend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, some superstitious rot.... But look here, Maria-Teresa, I&rsquo;m an awful
      coward. Do you think your father...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! He&rsquo;ll do anything I like if he is asked at the right moment
      We&rsquo;ll be married in three months&rsquo; time from San Domingo. Truly we will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear!... But I&rsquo;m only a poor devil of an engineer, and he may not
      think me much of a son-in-law for the Marquis de la Torre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, you&rsquo;re clever, and I make you a gift of the whole of Peru.
      There&rsquo;s plenty to do there for an engineer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly believe my luck, Maria-Teresa! That I&mdash;I.... But, tell
      me, how did it all happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old, old way. First you are neighbors, or meet by accident. Then you
      are friends... just friends, nothing else.... And then...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their hands joined, and they remained thus for a moment, in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a burst of noise came from the courtyard, and a moment later a
      hurried knock announced the entrance of an excited employee. At the sight
      of the stranger, he stopped short, but Maria-Teresa told him to speak.
      Dick, who both understood and spoke Spanish well, listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Indians are back from the Islands, señorita. There has been trouble
      between them and the Chinamen. One coolie was killed and three were badly
      wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa showed no outward sign of emotion. Her voice hardened as she
      asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did it happen... in the Northern Islands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, at Chincha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Huascar was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, señorita. He came back with them, and is outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send him in to me.&rdquo;

      office. Maria-Teresa, back at her desk, hardly raised her eyes. The
      newcomer, who took off his straw sombrero with a sweep worthy of a hidalgo
      of Castille, was a Trigullo Indian. These are perhaps the finest tribe of
      their race and claim descent from Manco-Capac, first king of the Incas. A
      mass of black hair, falling nearly to his shoulders, framed a profile
      which might have been copied from a bronze medallion. His eyes, strangely
      soft as he looked at the young girl before him, provoked immediate
      antagonism from Dick. He was wrapped in a bright-colored poncho, and a
      heavy sheath-knife hung from his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how it happened,&rdquo; ordered Maria-Teresa without returning the
      Indian&rsquo;s salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under his rigid demeanor, it was evident that he resented this tone before
      a stranger. Then he began to speak in Quichua, only to be interrupted and
      told to use Spanish. The Indian frowned and glanced haughtily at the
      listening engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting,&rdquo; said Maria-Teresa. &ldquo;So your Indians have killed one of my
      coolies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shameless ones laughed because our Indians fired cohetes in honor of
      the first quarter of the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not pay your Indians to pass their time in setting off fireworks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the occasion of the Noble Feast of the Moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know! The moon, and the stars, and the sun, and every Catholic
      festival as well! Your Indians do nothing but celebrate. They are lazy,
      and drunkards. I have stood them, so far because they were your friends,
      and you have always been a good servant, but this is too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shameless sons of the West are not your servants. They do not love
      you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but they work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For nothing... They have no pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the sons of dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They earn their wages.... Your men, I keep out of charity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charity!&rdquo; The Indian stepped back as if struck, and his hand, swung clear
      of the poncho, was lifted over his head as if in menace. Then it dropped
      and he strode to the door. But before opening it, he turned and spoke
      rapidly in Quichua, his eyes flaming. Then, throwing his poncho oyer his
      shoulder, he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa sat silent for a while, toying with her pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; asked Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he was going, and that I should never see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked furious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is not dangerous. It is a way they have. He says he did everything
      he could to prevent the trouble.... He is a good man himself, but his gang
      are hopeless. You have no idea what a nuisance these Indians are. Proud as
      Lucifer, and as lazy as drones.... I shall never employ another one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that make trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might! But what else can I do? I can&rsquo;t have all my coolies killed off
      like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what of Huascar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will do as he pleases.... He was brought up in the place, and was
      devoted to my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be hard for him to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to keep him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.... Goodness, we are forgetting all about your uncle!&rdquo; She rang, and a
      man came in. &ldquo;Order the motor.... By the way, what are the Indians doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve left with Huascar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, señorita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without saying a word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word, señorita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who paid them off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They refused to take any money. Huascar ordered them to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what of the Island coolies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have not been near the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the dead man... and the wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chinamen take them back to their own quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny people.... Tell them to bring the motor round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking she had put on a bonnet, and now drew on her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall drive,&rdquo; she said to the liveried negro boy who brought round the
      car.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they shot toward the Muelle Darsena, Dick admired the coolness with
      which she took the machine through the twisting streets. The boy,
      crouching at their feet, was evidently used to the speed, and showed no
      terror as they grazed walls and corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you do a great deal of motoring out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not very much. The roads are too bad. I always use this to get from
      Callao to Lima, and there are one or two runs to the seaside, to places
      like Ancon or Carillos&mdash;just a minute, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped the car, and waved her hand to a curly gray head which had
      appeared at a window, between two flower pots. This head reappeared at a
      low door, on the shoulders of a gallant old gentleman in sumptuous
      uniform. Maria-Teresa jumped out of the motor, exchanged a few sentences
      with him, and then rejoined Dick again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the Chief of Police,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I told him about that
      affair. There will be no trouble unless the Chinamen take legal
      proceedings, which is not likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached the steamers&rsquo; landing stage in time. The tugs had only just
      brought alongside the Pacific Steam Navigation Company&rsquo;s liner, on board
      which Uncle Francis was still taking notes:&mdash;&ldquo;On entering the port of
      Callao, one is struck, etc., etc.&rdquo; He lost precious material by not being
      with Maria-Teresa as she enthusiastically descriRed &ldquo;her harbor&rdquo; to
      Dick.... Sixty millions spent in improvements... 50,000 square meters of
      docks.... How she loved it all for its commercial bustle, for its constant
      coming and going of ships, for its intense life, and all it meant&mdash;the
      riches that would flow through it after the opening of the Panama Canal...
      the renascence of Peru.... Chili conquered and Santiago crushed... the
      defeat of 1878 avenged... and San Francisco yonder had best look to
      itself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, listening to the girl at his side, was amazed to hear her give
      figures with as much authority as an engineer, estimate profits as surely
      as, a shipowner. What a splendid little brain it was, and how much better
      than that imaginative, dreaming type which he deplored both in men and
      women, a type exemplified by his uncle with all his chimeric hypotheses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would all be so splendid,&rdquo; she added, frowning, &ldquo;if we only stopped
      making fools of ourselves. But we are always doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With our revolutions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were now standing on the quay, while the liner gradually swung in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, are they at it here as well? We found one on in Venezuela, and then
      another at Guayaquil. The city was under martial law, and some general or
      other who had been in power for about forty-eight hours was preparing to
      march on Quito and wipe out the government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is like an epidemic,&rdquo; went on the young girl, &ldquo;an epidemic which
      is sweeping the Andes just now. The news from Boloisa is worrying me, too.
      Things are bad round Lake Titicaca.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not really! That&rsquo;s a nuisance... not a cheerful outlook for my business
      in the Cuzco.&rdquo; Dick was evidently put out by the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not intended telling you about it until to-morrow. You must not
      think of unpleasant things to-day... all that district is in the hands of
      Garcia&rsquo;s men now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Garcia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one of my old suitors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has everybody in the country been in love with you, Maria-Teresa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I had the attraction of having been brought up abroad... at the
      first presidential ball I went to after mother&rsquo;s death there was no
      getting rid of them.... Garcia was there. And now he has raised the revolt
      among the Arequipa and Cuzco Indians.... He wants Vointemilla&rsquo;s place as
      president.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they have sent troops against them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, the two armies are out there... but, of course, they are not
      fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of the festival of the Interaymi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what on earth is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Festival of the Sun.... You see, three quarters, of the troops on
      both sides are Indian.... So, of course, they get drunk together during
      the fêtes.... In the end, Garcia will be driven over the Boloisan border,
      but in the meantime he is playing the very mischief with fertilizer
      rates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned toward the liner again, and, catching sight of Uncle Francis,
      raised her hand in reply to the frantic waving of a notebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Mr. Montgomery?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Did you enjoy the crossing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gangways were run out, and they went on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montgomery&rsquo;s first question was the same as had been his nephew&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and how is business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all those who knew her in Europe had marveled at the change which had
      come over the &ldquo;little girl&rdquo; at her mother&rsquo;s death, and her sudden
      determination to return to Peru and herself take charge of the family&rsquo;s
      fertilizer business and concessions. She had also been influenced in this
      decision by the fact that there were her little brother and sister,
      Isabella and Christobal, who needed her care. And finally there was her
      father, perhaps the greatest child of the three, who had always royally
      spent the money which his wife&rsquo;s business brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s mother, the daughter of a big Liverpool shipowner, met the
      handsome Marquis de la Torre one summer when he was an attaché at the
      Peruvian legation in London. The following winter she went back to Peru
      with him. Inheriting a great deal of her father&rsquo;s business acumen, she
      made a great success of a guano concession which her husband had hitherto
      left unexploited.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the marquis protested vigorously that the wife of Christobal de
      la Torre should not work, but when he found that he could draw almost to
      any extent on an ever-replenishing exchequer, he forgave her for making
      him so wealthy. Yet on his wife&rsquo;s death did he find it surprising that
      Maria-Teresa should have inherited her abilities, and allowed the daughter
      to take over all the duties which had been the mother&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is your father, my dear?&rdquo; asked Uncle Francis, still with a
      wary eye on his luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not expect to see you until to-morrow. They are going to give you
      such a reception! The whole Geographical Society is turning out in your
      honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his luggage had been taken to the station, and he had personally
      supervised its registration for Lima, Uncle Francis at last consented to
      take a seat in the motor, and Maria-Teresa put on full speed, for she
      wished to reach home before the early tropical nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      After passing a line of adobe houses and a few comfortable villas, they
      came to a long stretch of marshy ground, overgrown with reeds and willows,
      and spotted with clumps of banana trees and tamarisks, with here and there
      an eucalyptus or an araucaria pine. The whole countryside was burnt yellow
      by the sun, by a drought hardly ever relieved by a drop of rain, and which
      makes the campo round Lima and Callao anything but enchanting. A little
      further along they passed some scattered bamboo and adobe huts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This parched landscape would have been infinitely desolate had it not been
      relieved at intervals by the luxuriant growth surrounding some hacienda&mdash;sugar-cane,
      maize and rice plantations, making a brilliant green oasis round the white
      farm buildings. The badly-built clay roads which crossed the highway were
      peopled by droves of cattle, heavy carts, and flocks of sheep which
      mounted shepherds were bringing back to the farms. And all this animation
      formed a strange contrast to the arid aspect of the surrounding country.
      In spite of the jolting shaking of the car over a poorly kept road, Uncle
      Francis kept taking notes, and even more notes. Soon, with the lower spurs
      of the Cordilleras, they saw on the horizon the spires and domes which
      make Lima look almost like a Mussulman city.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now running alongside the Rimac, a stream infested by crayfish.
      Negro fishermen were to be seen every few yards dragging behind them in
      the water sacks attached to their belts, and in which they threw their
      catch to keep it alive. Turning to comment on them, Dick noticed
      Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s preoccupied air, and asked her the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very strange,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have not met a single Indian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The motor was almost in Lima now, having reached the famous Ciudad de los
      Reyes, the City of Kings founded by the Conquistador. Maria-Teresa, who
      loved her Lima, and wished to show it off, made a detour, swerving from
      the road and running a short distance along the stony bed of dried-up
      Rimac, careless of the risk to her tires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly the picturesque corner to which she brought them was worth the
      detour. The walls of the houses could hardly be seen, overgrown, as it
      were, with wooden galleries and balconies. Some of them were for all the
      world like finely carved boxes, adorned with a hundred arabesques&mdash;little
      rooms suspended in mid-air, with mysterious bars and trellised shutters,
      and strongly reminiscent of Peru or Bagdad. Only here it was not rare to
      see women&rsquo;s faces half hidden in the shadows, though in no way hiding. For
      the ladies of Lima are famed for their beauty and coquetry. They were to
      be seen here in the streets, wearing the manta, that fine black shawl
      which is wrapped round the head and shoulders and which no woman in South
      America uses with so much grace as the girl of Lima. Like the haik of the
      Mor, the manta hides all but two great dark eyes, but its wearer can, when
      she wishes, throw it aside just enough to give a sweet glimpse of
      harmonious features and a complexion made even more white by the provoking
      shadow of the veil. Dick had this amply proved to him, and seemed so
      interested that Maria-Teresa began to scold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are far too attractive in those mantas,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall show you
      some Europeans now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned the car up an adjoining street, which brought them to the new
      city, to broad roads and avenues opening up splendid vistas of the distant
      Andes. They crossed the Paseo Amancaes, which is the heart of the Mayfair
      of Lima, and Maria-Teresa several times exchanged bows with friends and
      acquaintances. Here the black manta was replaced by Paris hats overdressed
      from the rue de la Paix, for its discreet shadow is too discreet to be
      correct at nightfall. It was the hour at which all fashionable Lima was
      driving or walking, or gossiping in the tearooms, where one loiters
      happily over helados in an atmosphere of chiffons, flirting and politics.
      When they reached the Plaza Mayor, the first stars had risen on the
      horizon. The crowd was dense, and carriages advanced only at a walking
      pace. Women dressed as for the ball, with flowers in their dark curls,
      passed in open carriages. Young men grouped round a fountain in the center
      of the square, raised their hats and smiled into passing victorias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really is strange,&rdquo; murmured Maria-Teresa, &ldquo;not an Indian in sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they generally come to this part of the city, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there are always some who come to watch the people come past....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standing in front of a café was a group of half-breeds, talking politics.
      One could distinctly hear the names of Garcia and Vointemilla, the
      president, neither of them treated over gently. One of the group,
      evidently a shopkeeper, was moaning his fears of a return to the era of
      pronunciamentos.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car turned at the corner of the cathedral, and entered a rather narrow
      street. Seeing the way clear, Maria-Teresa put on speed only to pull up
      sharply a second later, just in time to avoid running down a man wrapped
      in a poncho, who stood motionless in the middle of the street. Both young
      people recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huascar!&rdquo; exclaimed Maria-Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huascar, señorita, who begs you to take another road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road is free to all, Huascar. Stand aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huascar has nothing more to say to the señorita. To pass, she must pass
      over Huascar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick half rose in his seat, as if to intervene, but Maria-Teresa put a
      hand on his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You behave very strangely, Huascar,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why are there no Indians
      in the town to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huascar&rsquo;s brethren do as they please, they are free men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders, thought a moment, and began to turn the car
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before starting again, however, she spoke to the Indian, who had not
      moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you always my friend, Huascar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an answer, the Indian slowly raised his sombrero, and looked up to the
      early stars, as if calling them to witness. With a brief &ldquo;Adios!&rdquo;
       Maria-Teresa drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the motor stopped again, it was before a big house, the door-keeper
      of which rushed out to help his young mistress to alight. He was
      forestalled, however, by the Marquis de la Torre himself, who had just
      driven up, and who greeted the two Montgomerys with delight. &ldquo;Enter,
      señor. This house is yours,&rdquo; he said grandly to Uncle Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis was a slim little gentleman of excessive smartness, dressed
      almost like a young man. When he moved and he was hardly ever still, he
      seemed to radiate brilliancy: from his eyes, his clothes, his jewels. But
      for all that, he was never undignified, and kept his grand manner without
      losing his vivacity in circumstances when others would have had to arm
      themselves with severity. Outside his club and the study of geographical
      questions he cared for nothing so much as romping with his son Christobal,
      a sturdy youngster of seven. At times one might have taken them for
      playmates on a holiday from the same school, filling the house with their
      noise, while little Isabella, who was nearly six, and loved ceremony,
      scolded them pompously, after the manner of an Infanta.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Marquis de la
      Torre&rsquo;s residence was half modern, half historical, with here and there
      quaint old-fashioned rooms and corners. Don Christobal was something of a
      collector, and had adorned his home with ancient paneling, carved
      galleries several centuries old, rude furniture dating back to before the
      conquest, faded tapestry&mdash;all so many relics of the various towns of
      old Peru which his ancestors had first sacked and then peopled. And each
      object recalled some anecdote or Story which the host detailed at length
      to all willing listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in one of these historical corners that Mr. Montgomery and his
      nephew were presented to two old ladies&mdash;two Velasquez canvases
      brought to life, yet striving to retain all their pictorial dignity.
      Attired after a fashion long since forgotten, Aunt Agnes and her duenna
      might almost have been taken for antiques of Don Christobal&rsquo;s collection:
      they lived altogether in another age, and their happiest moments were
      those passed in telling fear-inspiring legends. All the tales of old Peru
      had a home in this ancient room of theirs, and many an evening had been
      whiled away there by these narratives&mdash;the two Christobals, father
      and son, and little Infanta Isabella listening in one corner, while
      Maria-Teresa, at the other end of the room, went over her accounts and
      wrote her letters in a great splash of yellow lamplight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Francis was delighted to meet in real life two such perfect types of
      the New Spain of yore, set in the very frame they needed. They were great
      friends at once, and the savant, taken to his own room, changed his
      clothes hurriedly to be able to rejoin them. At dinner, installed between
      the two, he begged for more legends, more stories. Maria-Teresa, thinking
      it time to talk of more serious matters, interrupted by telling her father
      of the trouble between the Indians and coolies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they heard that Maria-Teresa had discharged the Indians, Aunt Agnes
      shook her head doubtfully, and Irene openly expressed her disapproval.
      Both agreed that the young girl had acted imprudently, and particularly so
      on the eve of the Interaymi festival. This view was also taken by the
      Marquis, whose protest took an even more active form when he learned that
      Huascar had also left. Huascar had always been a very faithful servant, he
      argued, and his brusk departure was strange. Maria-Teresa explained
      shortly that for some time past Huascar&rsquo;s manner had displeased her, and
      that she had let him know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is another matter,&rdquo; said the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am no more comfortable about it... there is something in the air...
      the Indians are not behaving normally.... The other day, in the Plaza
      Mayor, I heard extraordinary remarks being made by some half-breeds to a
      couple of Quichua chiefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we did not meet a single Indian on the way from Callao, and I have
      not seen one in the city,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Why is that, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of the festival,&rdquo; interjected Aunt Agnes. &ldquo;They have their secret
      meetings. They disappear into the mountains, or some warren of theirs&mdash;catacombs
      like the Early Christians. One day, the order comes from some corner of
      the Andes, and they vanish like shadows, to reappear a few days later like
      a swarm of locusts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister exaggerates a little,&rdquo; said the Marquis, smiling. &ldquo;They are not
      so very dangerous, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you yourself are worried, Christobal. You have just said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only because there might be some rioting....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they got it in them?&rdquo; asked Mr. Montgomery. &ldquo;They seem so
      nerveless....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not all like that.... Yes, we have had one or two native
      rebellions, but it was never anything very serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many of them are there in the country?&rdquo; put in Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two-thirds of the population,&rdquo; answered Maria-Teresa. &ldquo;But they are
      no more capable of really rebelling than they are of working properly. It
      is the Garcia business that has unsettled them, coming after a long period
      of quiet.&rdquo; She turned to her father. &ldquo;What does the President think of it
      all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not seem to worry a great deal. This Indian unrest recurs every
      ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why every ten years?&rdquo; demanded Uncle Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of the Sun Festival,&rdquo; said old Irene. &ldquo;The Quichuas hold it every
      ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Dick took a sudden interest. &ldquo;Nobody knows,&rdquo; replied Aunt Agnes,
      in a nervously strangled voice. &ldquo;There are sacrifices... and the ashes of
      the victims are thrown into rivers and streams... to carry away the sins
      of the nation, the Indians believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is really very interesting!&rdquo; exclaimed Uncle Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the sacrifices are human,&rdquo; half groaned the old lady, dropping
      her head to her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human sacrifices!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Auntie!&rdquo; laughed Maria-Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; remarked the savant. &ldquo;And there may be some truth in it. I know
      that they were customary at the Festival of the Sun among the Incas. And
      Prescott makes it clear that the Quichuas have kept not only the language
      of their ancestors, but also many of the ancient customs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but they became Christians when the Spaniards conquered their
      country,&rdquo; suggested Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that that affects them much,&rdquo; commented the Marquis. &ldquo;It gives them
      two religions instead of one, and they have mixed up the rites and beliefs
      of the two in a most amazing fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they want to do, then? Re-build the Empire of the Incas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know what they want,&rdquo; replied Maria-Teresa. &ldquo;In the days of
      the Incas every living being in the Empire had to work, were practically
      the slaves of the Sons of Sun. When that iron discipline was removed they
      gradually learned to do nothing but sleep. Of course, that meant poverty
      and misery, which they attribute, not to their laziness, but to the fact
      that they are no longer ruled by the descendants of Mono-Capac! From what
      Huascar told me, they still hope for a return of the old kings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they still go in for human sacrifice?&rdquo; asked Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not! What absolute nonsense!&rdquo; Aunt Agnes and Irene both turned
      to Uncle Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa was brought up abroad, and does not know.... She cannot
      know.... But she is wrong to laugh at what she calls &lsquo;all these old
      stories.&rsquo;... There is plenty of proof, and we are sure of it.... Every ten
      years&mdash;all great events were decennial among the Incas&mdash;every
      ten years, the Quichua Indians offer a bride to the Sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bride to the Sun?&rdquo; exclaimed Uncle Francis, half horrified, half
      incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... they sacrifice a young girl in one of those horrible Inca temples
      of theirs, where no stranger has ever gone!... It is terrible, but it is
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really... it is so difficult to believe.... Do you mean to say that they
      kill her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do... as a sacrifice to the Sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how? By fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is even more horrible than that. Death by fire is only for far
      more unimportant ceremonies. At the Interaymi, they wall up their victim
      alive.... And it is always a Spanish girl.... They kidnap one, as
      beautiful and of as good family as possible. It is vengeance against the
      race that destroyed theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa was frankly laughing at her aunt&rsquo;s intense seriousness, only
      equaled by gravity with which Uncle Francis listened. The savant looked at
      her smiling face half disapprovingly, and brought his scientific knowledge
      to the defense of the old ladies. Everything they said corresponded
      perfectly with what well-known writers and explorers had been able to
      discover about the Virgins of the Sun. There was no doubt that human
      sacrifice had been rife among the Incas, both in honor of the Sun and for
      the King himself, many of the victim» going to the altar of their own free
      will. This was particularly the case when an Inca died&mdash;it was like
      Suttee of the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prescott and Wiener, the greatest authorities on the subject, are
      agreed,&rdquo; said Uncle Francis. &ldquo;Prescott tells us that at one royal burial,
      more than a thousand people, wives, maids and servants of the Inca, were
      sacrificed on his tomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Agnes shuddered, while Irene, bending her head, made the sign of the
      Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is very true, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Don Christobal, carrying on the
      conversation, &ldquo;and I see that our Geographical Society here will be able
      to give you very little that is new to you. Would it interest you to visit
      our latest excavations at Ancon to-morrow? There is ample proof there that
      Suttee was practised among the Incas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What exactly were these Virgins of the Sun?&rdquo; asked Dick, turning to his
      uncle, who, delighted to be able to show his erudition, at once launched
      into an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Virgins of the Sun, or the &lsquo;elected ones,&rsquo; as they were called, were
      young girls, vowed to the service of the divinity. They were taken from
      their families as children, and put into convents where they were placed
      under the care of women called mammaconas,&mdash;girls who had grown old
      in these monasteries. Under the guidance of these venerable matrons, the
      virgins were taught their religious duties, weaving and embroidery were
      their chief occupations, and it was they who made the fine vicuna wool for
      the hangings of the temples and the Inca&rsquo;s home and attire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said gray-haired Irene, &ldquo;but their chief duty was to guard the
      sacred fire acquired anew by the temple at each Raymi festival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; replied the savant. &ldquo;They lived absolutely alone. From the
      moment they entered the home, they were entirely cut off from their
      families and friends. The Inca alone, and his queen, the Coya, were
      allowed within the sacred precincts. The most rigid discipline and
      supervision were exercised over them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And woe to the girl who transgressed,&rdquo; added Aunt Irene. &ldquo;By Inca law she
      was buried alive, while the town or village from which she came was razed
      to the ground and &lsquo;sown with stones,&rsquo; so that all memory of it should be
      lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are perfectly right, madam,&rdquo; agreed Uncle Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet country!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an amazing civilization they must have possessed,&rdquo; continued Uncle
      Francis. &ldquo;The ceremonies of their temples are almost identical with those
      of ancient Rome.... Little did Christopher Columbus think, when he saw a
      few painted savages, that on the other seaboard, behind this belt of
      primitive land and tribes, there was a whole world with its customs,
      monuments, laws and conquests. Two empires, sir: that of the Aztecs in
      Mexico, that of the Incas in Peru. And with civilizations rivaling that of
      the Mediterranean. It is as if an Eastern prince, reaching the steppes of
      Scythia, had claimed the discovery of Europe, returning to his States
      without knowing that Rome existed, and convinced that the rest of the
      world was a howling waste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have been a bit of a fool,&rdquo; hazarded Dick. &ldquo;A true conqueror
      guesses there are new lands to conquer even before he sees them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Pizarro and Cortes!&rdquo; exclaimed the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who came to destroy everything...&rdquo; began Uncle Francis. Fortunately, Don
      Christobal did not hear him, and he stopped in time. Maria-Teresa, seated
      opposite the savant, had trodden on his foot, and he bit his lip,
      remembering that de la Torre, the Marquis&rsquo; ancestor, had been one of
      Pizarro&rsquo;s &ldquo;destroyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both old ladies, however, had heard, and opened their eyes at this
      denunciation of a cause which to them was that of the true faith against
      the infidel. Maria-Teresa, anxious to smooth matters over, quickly brought
      them back to their Inca legends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is very fine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but there is nothing to show that the
      Indians still sacrifice human brings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say that!&rdquo; they exclaimed in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, has anybody ever had definite proof of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Agnes was not to be shaken in her convictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was a little girl,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;I had an old nurse who belonged
      to one of the Lake Titicaca tribes of Quichuas. She told me that she
      herself had seen three Spanish girls walled up alive at three successive
      Interaymi fêtes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did the girls come from?&rdquo; asked Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were Lima girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, any number of people must have known of it,&rdquo; he answered,
      secretly amused by the grave airs of the two old ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, and is, common property,&rdquo; retorted Aunt Agnes. &ldquo;The names of
      their last two victims were known to everybody. One vanished ten years
      ago, and the other ten years before that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, common property!&rdquo; laughed Don Christobal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to laugh about, Christobal,&rdquo; said Aunt Agnes drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the duenna repeated in a low voice, &ldquo;No, no, nothing to laugh about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis was determined to have his laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us mourn the poor children,&rdquo; he said, groaning. &ldquo;Cut off from the
      affection of their parents at so early an age! How terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christobal, can you tell me what became of Amelia de Vargas and Marie
      Cristina de Orellana?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, what became of them?&rdquo; urged Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There we are!... the old story! I expected it!&rdquo; exclaimed the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might speak seriously! You knew Amelia de Vargas....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A charming girl... the sweetest smile in the city!... That was twenty
      years ago.... How time flies!... Yes, she disappeared... with a poor
      cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard the other day that it was a toreador,&rdquo; interjected Maria-Teresa.
      &ldquo;They revive that old story every ten years, at the time of the
      Interaymi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She disappeared outside the bull-ring,&rdquo; explained Aunt Agnes. &ldquo;There was
      a fight in the crowd, and she was separated from her parents. Nobody ever
      saw her again. Afterwards, some people remembered catching sight of her
      surrounded by a group of Indians. She died at their hands, walled up
      alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a gorgeous imagination crowds have! But the fact remains that that
      poor cousin of hers disappeared about the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are pleased to say, Christobal. But what of Maria Cristina de
      Orellana?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was another matter... a very sad case. She was out for a walk
      with her father round the Cuzco, and went into one of the caves, never to
      reappear. She lost her way in the old subterranean passages, of course.
      The government had all the entrances blocked up after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And since then,&rdquo; commented Aunt Agnes, &ldquo;her poor father has been a
      madman. For the past ten years, he has haunted the Cuzco ruins, calling in
      vain to his daughter. He, at all events, will not believe that she was not
      carried off by the Indians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you yourself say he is mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lost his reason when he acquired the certitude that she had perished
      in their temple. A few days before she vanished, Maria-Cristina
      mysteriously received a very old and very heavy gold bracelet. That
      bracelet had a center plaque representing the sun....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Agnes, you know that in this country jewelers stick the sun in
      wherever and whenever they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That bracelet was the real one... the same one that was sent to Amelia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not exaggerating, Agnes? Really, really!... And with stories like
      these running about, they expect poor historians to be accurate!... I hope
      you are not taking notes of all this, Mr. Montgomery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am exaggerating nothing,&rdquo; retorted Aunt Agnes obstinately. &ldquo;It was the
      real Golden Sun bracelet.... Every ten years since Atahualpa, the last
      Inca king, was burned alive by Pizarro, the Inca priests have sent it to a
      Spanish girl they had chosen to be the Bride of the Sun. And every one of
      them has been walled up alive.... I remember that poor Orellana girl
      laughing and joking about the Golden Sun bracelet! The whole town knew
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole town always does have a pretty lively imagination at the time
      of the Interaymi,&rdquo; insisted the Marquis. He turned to Mr. Montgomery. &ldquo;You
      have no idea, my dear sir, how hard it is for our Society to get away from
      all these weird legends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legends are not things to be despised in research work,&rdquo; disagreed Uncle
      Francis. &ldquo;For my part, I am delighted to have found a country where they
      are still so living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a servant came in with a small parcel on a silver tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A registered package, señorita,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will the señorita sign here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa, having signed, was turning the box over in her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is from Cajamarca,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Who from, I wonder? I know nobody
      there. ... Will you excuse me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl cut the string, broke the seals and opened the little
      wooden box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bracelet!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and laughed a little nervously. &ldquo;What an
      extraordinary coincidence!... Why, it is the Golden Sun bracelet! It is,
      really! The bracelet of the Bride of the Sun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every person in the room had risen, with the exception of the two old
      ladies, who sat as if stunned. All eyes were turned on the heavy bracelet
      in darkened old gold, with its sun-adorned center plaque on which the rays
      seemed blurred out by the dust of centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is funny!&rdquo; laughed Maria-Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; exclaimed the Marquis, whose voice had changed a little.
      &ldquo;Evidently a joke by Alonso de Cuelar. You refused him, my dear, and he
      has invented rather a pretty revenge. His little vengeance on the Bride of
      the Sun.... All the young men of the town call you that because you refuse
      to marry.... Well, what are we looking so blue about over there? Surely,
      Agnes, you are not going to make yourself ill over a harmless joke like
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa was showing the bracelet to Uncle Francis and Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I think I shall keep it! Tell Don Alonso I shall
      wear it as a token of friendship.... It really is a beauty!... What do you
      think of it, Mr. Montgomery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me at least three or four hundred years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pieces like that are still occasionally found in excavations round royal
      tombs, but they are rare,&rdquo; said the Marquis. &ldquo;I am not surprised Don
      Alonso had to go to Cajamarca for that one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Cajamarca?&rdquo; asked Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cajamarca,&rdquo; said the savant, horrified at his nephew&rsquo;s ignorance, &ldquo;is the
      Caxamarxa of the Incas, their second capital in Pizarro&rsquo;s day....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the city where their last king was burned at the stake!&rdquo; groaned Aunt
      Agnes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rushed to her side, for she was on the point of fainting and had to
      be carried to her room. The old duenna followed them, as white as her
      lace, and crossing herself tremulously.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the day after
      his arrival, Uncle Francis was solemnly and officially received by the
      Geographical Society of Lima, the fine archeological, statistical and
      hydrographical work of which keenly interested him. With so much
      scientific enthusiasm did he express himself, that he conquered all
      hearts. By far the proudest and happiest man present, however, was Don
      Christobal, basking in the reflected glory of his distinguished guest. As
      they were all leaving after the ceremony&mdash;Maria-Teresa wearing her
      bracelet despite the protests of her aunt and the duenna&mdash;the Marquis
      met Don Alonso de Cuelar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cuelar,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I thought you were at Cajamarca!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Alonso opened his eyes in surprise, evidently not understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Cuelar, you may confess. I shall not be angry. Both
      Maria-Teresa and I agree that your little revenge was a very neat one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My revenge?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! The bracelet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What bracelet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Maria-Teresa and Dick joined the group. Maria-Teresa,
      seeing her father laughing as he talked, felt quite sure that the mystery
      of the bracelet had already been cleared up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you ever so much,&rdquo; she said, holding out the slim hand adorned by
      the heavy bracelet &ldquo;You see, I wear it as a token of friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should never have permitted myself such a liberty,&rdquo; protested the
      young man, looking in amazement from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you serious?... It really was not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!... But what does it all mean?... And what a peculiar bracelet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not recognize it?&rdquo; laughed Maria-Teresa, still unconvinced. &ldquo;It
      is, apparently, the Golden Sun bracelet which the Indian priests always
      send to the Bride of the Sun at the Interaymi.... And as you, I
      understand, were the originator of my nickname, I naturally supposed that,
      in spite of everything you heard, you bore no malice to the Virgin of the
      Sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a charming idea! I am only sorry,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that it was not mine.
      I shall never forgive myself for not having thought of it. You must
      attribute it, señorita, to one of those other unfortunates who, like
      myself, have worshiped in vain.... There is Pedro Ribera.... He looks dark
      enough to have done it.... Ribera!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ribera knew no more of the bracelet than Don Alonso. He also admired
      the strange jewel, and was equally sorry he had not sent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal was becoming irritated, and was sorry now that he had
      mentioned the matter to them. He could not, without appearing ridiculous,
      ask them not to speak of it, and he knew very well that within two hours
      every tea-table in the Plaza Mayor would be discussing the new topic.
      Maria-Teresa guessed his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As our guess was wrong, the whole thing rather loses point So we must
      wait until the generous donor comes and confesses. In the meantime, let it
      be forgotten.&rdquo; And, slipping off the bracelet, she put it into her
      reticule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if it was Huascar,&rdquo; suggested Dick, as the two young men left
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huascar? Why Huascar?&rdquo; asked the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s an old Indian bracelet.... He&rsquo;s the only Indian I know of, and
      I know he is very devoted to the family. Suppose he found the bracelet in
      some old ruin and didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let us not talk of it any more,&rdquo; interrupted Maria-Teresa, slightly
      troubled. &ldquo;What does it matter!... Besides, we are bound to know, sooner
      or later.... Some day a friend of father&rsquo;s, back from the Sierra, will ask
      me why I am not wearing his present. That is sure to happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; affirmed Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis, far from satisfied, and still seeking a possible explanation,
      suddenly turned on Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sent it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Why, I have only just arrived in the country....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you could very well have bought it when the liner put in at
      Guayaquil, and then sent it to some agent or other at Gajamarca to have it
      forwarded here.... You must have read the legend of the bracelet in one of
      your uncle&rsquo;s books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Father!&rdquo; protested Maria-Teresa. &ldquo;Mr. Montgomery is an
      engineer....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. Very hard-working.... Come here to try experiments with
      some new pump to clear the Cuzco gold-mines of water.... I know all
      that.... But that is no reason why he should not send you a bracelet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should he, Father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there not a reason why he should, my daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time, Maria-Teresa blushed deeply and Dick tried to look unconcerned,
      while Don Christobal smiled at them quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you thought your old father was blind, eh?... You thought he guessed
      nothing... that he did not understand what you had left behind you in
      London?... Well, Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sir... I... I... hardly dared hope....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?... There, there, that&rsquo;s enough.... You may put the bracelet
      on her arm again.... Pair of young fools.&rdquo; Maria-Teresa slipped her arm
      through her father&rsquo;s, and squeezed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to Dick and opening her reticule, she whispered rapidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you sent it. What can it matter?&rdquo; Dick, completely taken aback,
      clasped the bracelet on Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s wrist without protest. He scarcely
      heard a word said by the Marquis, who was delighted to have solved the
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, young man, you can flatter yourself that you thoroughly mystified
      everybody.&rdquo; And with that he hurried after Uncle Francis, who had been
      carried off to drink champagne by a group of admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick and Maria-Teresa, left alone, exchanged looks. A moment later, they
      were brought to earth again by the advent of a horde of excited
      scientists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what will your father say when he finds out who really sent the
      bracelet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will forgive you. I only made you tell the story to reassure him....
      Between you and me, those old tales told by Aunt Agnes and Irene were
      worrying him a little.... He is rather a child in some ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carriages and motors were rapidly filling with people starting for the
      excavations outside the town, and then on by rail to Ancon, where Uncle
      Francis was to be shown the latest Inca discoveries. The Marquis and Mr.
      Montgomery passed them in one motor. Maria-Teresa waved to them, and
      walked on towards the town with Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all to meet again that evening to dine and pass the night at the
      Marquis&rsquo; sea-side villa between Lima and Ancon. Uncle Francis would thus
      be able to begin his researches the very next morning, for Don
      Christobal&rsquo;s villa, itself a treasure-house of antiques, stood in the very
      center of the excavations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the young people, less interested in things of death than the
      members of the Geographical and Archaeological Society, went to explore
      Lima. It was only after a long walk in the Pascos de Amancaes that they in
      their turn started by motor over an execrable road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach of night could already be felt, and the great plain over
      which they were speeding was made even more desolate by the presence of
      the slow-flying gallinazos, or black vultures, overhead. These scavengers,
      half-starved in appearance, are the common adjuncts of scenery in Peru,
      tolerated and even respected, as they are, by a grateful municipality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there were haciendas, each with its group of pastures and grazing
      horses, kept from galloping into the surrounding waste by the four-foot
      mud walls. Otherwise, it was a sandy desert, at some points dotted with
      skeletons of a long-dead race dug up by curious scientists and then left
      to bleach in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly cheerful,&rdquo; commented Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa, intent on her driving, did not answer, but pointed with one
      gauntleted hand at a group of half-breeds playing bowls with human skulls
      at the corner of a hacienda.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were soon in the outskirts of Ancon, and found the Marquis, Uncle
      Francis, and their fellow-scientists busily arguing in the center of an
      Inca cemetery. On all sides were opened tombs, each containing a mummy
      rudely drawn from its thousand-year sleep by the pick of the excavator.
      Dick and Maria-Teresa had left their motor, but did not join the others.
      Instead, they wandered silently, almost sadly, in another direction, and
      the car had started off again in the care of the negro chauffeur, to be
      garaged at Ancon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is horrible,&rdquo; said Maria-Teresa, pressing Dick&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Why cannot
      they leave them in peace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seated on a little mound well out of sight of the others, they forgot
      their surroundings. And it was in this horrible burial-ground they
      exchanged their first true lovers&rsquo; kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of voices brought them back to reality. The president of the
      Society, followed by an interested retinue, was explaining the most
      interesting tombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walking through this necropolis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is no effort to evoke the
      shades of the Incas, and to feel for a minute as if one were living among
      them.... Here, six feet below ground, we first found a dog which had been
      sacrificed on its master&rsquo;s tomb.... The dead man&rsquo;s wife and chief servants
      also followed him to the next world.... We next found the wife&rsquo;s body....
      Like the dog, she had been strangled, probably because she had not had the
      courage to take her own life.... Finally, we heard the Indian workman cry
      ont, &lsquo;Aqui esta el muerto.&rsquo; (Here is the dead one)... for to the native
      mind, the only body worthy of notice is that of the master.... When we cut
      the thongs and unrolled the wrappings about him&mdash;the man had
      evidently been a great chief&mdash;we found the mummy in an extraordinary
      state of preservation,&mdash;the head was almost intact.... Gentlemen, the
      ancient Egyptians did no better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, excited ones from another part of the cemetery attracted
      their attention, and a workman ran up to tell them that a sensational
      discovery had been made&mdash;the tomb of three Inca chiefs with
      strange-shaped skulls. Dick and Maria-Teresa followed the others to the
      spot indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the newly-discovered tomb, workmen were passing up to
      the surface little sacks full of corn, jars which had once contained
      chicha&mdash;all the things necessary for a long voyage. Then came
      golden-vases, silver amphora, goblets, hammered statuettes, jewels:&mdash;a
      veritable treasure brought to light by one stroke of the pick. Finally,
      the three mummies were brought to the surface and unrolled with every
      precaution. One of the scientists present bent down to uncover the faces,
      and there was a murmur of horror from those present.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand what Dick and Maria-Teresa had been among the first to see,
      it is necessary for the reader to know that it was customary among the
      Incas to shape living skulls to any form they wished. This strange custom
      exists even in modern days, though in a far lesser degree, among the
      Basque inhabitants of the Pyrenees. The skulls of babies, set in vices or
      bound into various molds, were gradually deformed till they took the shape
      of a sugar-loaf, of a squarish box, of an enormous lime, and so forth.
      Phrenology was evidently a science known to the Incas, who, precursors of
      Gall and Spezhurn, thus sought to develop abnormally the intellectual or
      warlike qualities of a child by compressing or enlarging such and such a
      part of the brain. It has been proved, though, that this practise was
      allowed only in the case of children of the Inca himself, called upon in
      afterlife to take high position in the State. The common people kept their
      normal skulls and normal brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the three heads just brought to light, one was cuneiform&mdash;a
      monstrous sugar-loaf. It was horrible to see this nightmare face, like the
      head of a beast of the Apocalypse, framed in locks which seemed to be
      still living as they gently moved in the sea breeze. The second head was
      flattened out, cap-like, with a huge bump at the back.. The third was
      almost square, resembling nothing so much as a small valise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa shrank before this triple horror and, despite his evident
      curiosity, drew her fiancé away from the violated sepulchre. They strolled
      down to the beach, where the Pacific murmured gently as it came to rest on
      the sands. So peaceful is the sea at Ancon, so free from currents and
      gales, that it has become the great resort of the inhabitants of Lima. At
      this season, however, it was still deserted, so that Dick and Maria-Teresa
      met nobody during their walk to the Marquis&rsquo; villa.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dusk when they reached it, still under the depressing influence of
      the three strange heads, and vainly trying to joke the impression away. As
      the sun disappeared on the horizon, the wind rose and conjured up in the
      half-light pale sand-whorls which might have been so many phantoms dancing
      up from the huacas to reproach them for impiety and sacrilege. Though they
      were neither of them over-imaginative, the young people were glad to see
      the fat major-domo who came forward to announce that the Marquis and Uncle
      Francis had already arrived. He, at all events, was solid flesh and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Maria-Teresa entered the house, a little Quichua maid, Concha,
      literally threw herself at her mistress&rsquo; feet, protesting that she had
      been dead in the señorita&rsquo;s absence, and had been brought to life again by
      her return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what devotion we get here for eight soles a month!&rdquo; she laughed,
      completely cured of her fears by the sight of the familiar objects about
      her. &ldquo;Into the bargain, she cooks puchero, our native stew, to perfection.
      You must try it some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Señorita,&rdquo; interjected the maid, her broad lips parting in an enormous
      smile, &ldquo;I have prepared locro for to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was not a very long meal. Everybody was tired, and Uncle Francis
      was anxious to be up early in the morning. Dick and Maria-Teresa
      prosaically enjoyed their locro&mdash;a maize cooked with meat, spiced and
      served with the chicha which still further heightens the taste of all
      popular dishes in Peru&mdash;and, when they parted at the doors of their
      rooms on the first floor, were quite ready to laugh over the incidents of
      the afternoon. Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s hand lingered in Dick&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, little Bride of the Sun,&rdquo; he said, and bending down, kissed
      the disk on the bracelet. &ldquo;But surely you are not going to keep that thing
      on?... A bracelet from the Lord knows where and the Lord knows whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dear to me now, Dick.... Now that you have kissed it, it shall
      never leave me.... Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared into her room, and the young engineer had turned toward
      his when a shriek was heard, and Maria-Teresa rushed to the landing, in a
      panic of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are in there! They are in there!&rdquo; she gasped, her teeth chattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What?... what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The three living skulls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you they are! All three of them, staring in through the window!...
      They looked at me with such eyes... horrible, living eyes.... No, no!...
      Dick!... Don&rsquo;t go in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking the light from her trembling hand, Dick went into the room. There
      was nothing to be seen. He crossed to the balcony, and threw open the
      French windows: on one side was the sea, on the other a panorama over the
      flat country and the Inca burial-ground. Everything was perfectly normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, dear.... You must have imagined....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, I tell you I saw them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, on the balcony, staring through the panes.... Those three Inca
      chiefs with their hideous heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Maria-Teresa, be reasonable. They are dead.... You yourself saw them
      dug up.... Surely you cannot believe in ghosts....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those I saw were not ghosts. They were living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thinking to reassure her, he began to laugh heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Dick, don&rsquo;t!... I did see them... they were exactly like those in
      the grave... the sugar-loaf, the cap, and the valise.... Exactly the
      same!... But what did they come here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal, drawn from the smoking-room by the noise, jeered at his
      daughter&rsquo;s fears. Uncle Francis, too, appeared in a night-cap, which
      started everybody laughing except Maria-Teresa. To quieten her, the
      major-domo was sent round the house and explored the grounds. He returned
      to report that he had found nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are worried by what you saw this afternoon, my child,&rdquo; said the
      Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Maria-Teresa would not reenter the room, and ordered another on the
      opposite side of the villa to be prepared for her. Dick, using every
      argument he could think of, finally convinced her that she had been the
      victim of a hallucination. Half ashamed of herself, she made him go out to
      the first-floor balcony with her, trying, in her turn, to efface any
      unfavorable impression she might have made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balcony on which they were was almost directly over the sea, for on
      this side the beach reached right up to the walls of the villa. After a
      time, the immense peace of the night completed Dick&rsquo;s work, and the girl
      was perfectly quiet when she took off her bracelet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this is what has been worrying me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I never before
      imagined that I saw a ghost....&rdquo; And she threw the bracelet into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good place for it,&rdquo; agreed Dick. &ldquo;A ring will do ever so much
      better. You do at all events know where that comes from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before long the whole house was at rest, and the remainder of the night
      passed by quietly. But at seven o&rsquo;clock, when people were beginning to
      stir again, an agonized scream from Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s room sent the servants
      rushing to her aid. When they entered the room, they found their mistress
      sitting up in bed, staring at her wrist with horror-stricken eyes. The
      Golden Sun bracelet had returned during the night!

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ick was nearly as
      frightened as Maria-Teresa when he found what had happened. On the
      previous night he himself had seen her throw the bracelet into the sea,
      and yet it was there on her arm again when she woke up. What could it all
      mean? He could find nothing to say, and in spite of himself began to go
      over the terrible legend told by the two old ladies. It was preposterous,
      impossible, but he could not help believing in it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis and Uncle Francis, brought out by the noise, joined the others
      in the young girl&rsquo;s room. Don Christobal&rsquo;s sharp voice drove the servants
      from the room and brought out the whole story. Dick confessed his
      duplicity in the matter of the bracelet, and told how the jewel had been
      thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa was shaking with fever, and her father took her in his arms.
      He was less worried by the strange story told him than by the state in
      which his daughter was. He had always seen her so calm, so sure of
      herself, that her terror shook all his own matter-of-fact convictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Uncle Francis, half-pleased with this striking story for his next
      book, he could only repeat:&mdash;&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s impossible, you know. Quite
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then it was all explained in the most absurdly obvious way. Little
      Concha, back from marketing at Ancon, hurried to her mistress&rsquo; room and
      brought the solution of the mystery with her. Childishly naive, she
      explained that, on going out onto the beach in the morning, she had seen
      something glitter in the sand. She picked the object up, and found that it
      was a bracelet, which she recognized as one worn by her mistress on the
      previous day. Thinking that it had been lost from the balcony, and rushing
      to give Maria-Teresa a pleasant surprise, she had put it on her arm again
      without waking her. A huge burst of laughter from them all greeted the end
      of her simple story and Concha, terribly vexed, ran out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me we are all getting a little mad,&rdquo; said the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That infernal bracelet is enough to drive one to a lunatic asylum,&rdquo; added
      Dick. &ldquo;We must get rid of it at all costs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! If it ever came back a second time, I could not answer for my
      reason.&rdquo; And Maria-Teresa joined nervously in the laughter. &ldquo;What we all
      need,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;is a change of air, of scenery.... We ought to go for a
      little trip in the mountains, Father, and show a little of our country to
      Mr. Montgomery and Dick.... Suppose we start to-night?... Back to Lima
      first, and not a word to Aunt Agnes or Irene, for it would make them both
      ill.... I shall go into Callao with Dick to give a few orders, and in the
      evening we take the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get to the mountains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Father... to get to Pacasmayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pacasmayo!&rdquo; groaned the scientist &ldquo;A horrible place. I know it. Our liner
      put in there for four hours. There&rsquo;s nothing interesting in that part of
      the world, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing interesting! Why, do you know where one goes to from Pacasmayo?
      To Cajamarca, Mr. Montgomery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Francis straightened himself up:&mdash;&ldquo;Cajamarca!... the Caxamarxa
      of the Incas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cajamarca... the dream of my life, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to prevent it becoming a reality.... And at the same
      time, Father, we can find out the name of the mysterious sender of this
      thing. It was sent from Cajamarca, you remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excellent idea,&rdquo; agreed Don Christobal. &ldquo;We really must find a
      solution to that mystery as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whoever the joker is, he will pay for it,&rdquo; said Maria-Teresa, who was
      now toying with the bracelet. &ldquo;He laughs best who laughs last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With which she drove them all out of her room and called for Concha, who,
      when she came to dress her mistress, received a masterly box on the ears
      to teach her to wake people up next time she brought back a lost bracelet.
      Concha, unused to such treatment, burst into tears, and Maria-Teresa,
      ashamed of herself, filled the little maid&rsquo;s hands with chocolates to make
      her smile again. Do what she would, Maria-Teresa could not regain her
      calm. Every movement she made betrayed the inward storm, and she stamped
      whenever she thought of the cowardice she had shown....
    </p>
    <p>
      Broadly speaking, all roads in Peru are little more than mule-paths. The
      only exception is in favor of the great paved highways built by the Incas,
      which link the wilds of Bolivia to the capital of Ecuador, and in
      comparison with which the finest monuments of the Gallo-Roman period are
      not so very remarkable, after all. It is for this reason that travelers
      wishing to reach the interior must take boat along the coast to one of the
      harbor towns which are the termini of the railways leading into the
      ever-delightful Sierra.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Peru may be divided into three great parallel bands of country. First
      the Costa, or coast district, which rises gradually from the sea-board to
      an altitude of from 1,500 to 2,000 meters on the western slopes of the
      Andes. Then the Sierra, half mountain and half plateau, with altitudes
      varying between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Finally the Montaña, with its
      forests, which sweeps down to the east of the Cordilleras, stretching
      toward the Amazon in long slopes which, from 2,000 meters, gradually drop
      to only 500. Landscape, climate and products are all different in these
      three zones. The Costa is rich; the Sierra has smiling valleys and a
      relatively warm climate; the Montaña is a veritable ocean of verdure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most curious thing in this curious country is the variety of
      its landscape in a relatively small region, for to reach the Sierra one is
      obliged to scale some of the highest mountains in the world, and that in
      an equatorial country. In a few hours, one travels through districts where
      trees of all latitudes and plants of all climates grow and are cultivated
      side by side. Walnut-trees neighbor with waving palms; beetroot and
      sugar-cane grow in adjoining plantations; here, an orchard full of
      splendid apples; there a group of banana-trees spreading their broad
      leaves to the sun. In this amazing country, landowners can offer their
      guests drinks cooled with ice from the hills just above and made with
      sweet limes picked in the tropical gardens around the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Francis was in raptures, brimful of enthusiasm, and so schoolboyish
      in his delight that his companions could not help laughing. They teased
      the old gentleman constantly, and once the hiding of his fountain-pen at a
      moment when the taking of notes was urgent made him nearly frantic. All,
      in short, were in the best of spirits, and seemed to have completely
      forgotten the Golden Sun bracelet. This had been left in the care of Aunt
      Agnes and Irene, who immediately took it to the church of San Domingo and
      left it as an offering on the altar of the Lady Chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an exciting landing for the travelers at Pacasmayo. They got
      ashore with the aid of an enormous raft, rising and falling with the waves
      alongside the liner. This raft they reached by means of a cradle swung out
      on a small crane. All one had to do was to wait until the raft rose to
      within jumping distance of the cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa led the way, and landed very neatly on her feet; the Marquis,
      used to such gymnastics, followed suit; and Dick reached the raft with his
      hands still in his pockets. Uncle Francis, thinking hard of something
      else, arranged his own descent so badly that raft and cradle met with a
      crash which nearly jerked him into the sea. The shock was forgotten in a
      wave of enthusiasm over the novelty of it all, and he even retained his
      equanimity when the jerk of the grounding raft sent him rolling onto the
      wet sand of the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the following morning that the party left Pacasmayo,
      without any untoward incident to disturb the peace of a journey commenced
      under the most favorable auspices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick was the only one to think twice of the advent of a coppery-colored
      gentleman who seemed to have attached himself to their party. Had he not
      worn European dress, the stranger might well have passed for a typical
      Trujillo&mdash;that Indian race of which Huascar was certainly the finest
      representative. On the other hand, he wore his lounge suit with ease, and
      during the voyage evidenced his civilized upbringing by rendering to
      Maria-Teresa several of those little services which a man may allow
      himself to do when traveling, even to a woman he does not know. The
      stranger had embarked at Callao, had landed by the same raft as they, had
      stopped at the same inn in Pacasmayo, and, the following morning, took the
      same train for Cajamarca.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were so engrossed with the landscape of the lower ranges of the Andes
      that they did not at first notice his presence in their own carriage. He
      drew their notice to himself in such an unexpected manner that all,
      without knowing exactly why, experienced a strange feeling of discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a chorus of exclamations and interjections over the variety
      of the panorama before them, and they had just entered the wildest gorge
      imaginable, when the stranger said in a grave voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that camp, señores? That is where Pizarro&rsquo;s first messengers
      reached the last King of the Incas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All turned at the words. The stranger, standing at the back of the
      observation platform, seemed to see nobody; with arms crossed, he stared
      out toward the rocky fastnesses at the foot of which the world&rsquo;s greatest
      adventurer rested for a moment before starting on the conquest of an
      Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of my ancestors was there!&rdquo; exclaimed the Marquis involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know it! We know it!&rdquo; said the stranger, without turning, and in such
      a voice that the others exchanged astonished glances. His statuesque
      immobility also had its effect on them. Then after a moment&rsquo;s silence, he
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we have not forgotten that a Christobal de la Torre was with Pizarro.
      We know the whole story, sir. When Pizarro left the Spanish colony of
      Panama, vaguely guessing that before him was an empire even greater than
      the one which Cortes had just given to Charles V.; when, after a thousand
      dangers, he saw himself on the point of being deserted by all, he drew his
      sword and with the point drew a line in the sand, from east to west. Then,
      turning toward the south, he said: &lsquo;Comrades, on this side are danger,
      privation, hunger, nakedness, ruin and death; behind us, comfort and
      mediocrity. But to the south are also Peru and its riches, glory and
      immortality. Let each one decide for himself which is best for a hidalgo
      of Castille!&rsquo; And with those words, he crossed the line. He was followed
      by Ruiz, his brave pilot, then by Pedro de Candia, a knight born, as his
      name shows, in one of the Greek islands. Eleven others crossed that line,
      ready to follow their chief to the world&rsquo;s end. And among those eleven was
      Juan-Christobal de la Torre. We know it! Señor, we know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, pray, who are you, señor?&rdquo; demanded the Marquis brutally,
      exasperated by the stranger&rsquo;s manner, though he had in truth remained
      studiously polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if not hearing, as if intent on doing homage to the exploits of those
      dead Conquistadors, the stranger continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there not, señores, is there not, señorita, something gigantic in this
      spectacle? This little handful of men confidently starting on an
      expedition as wild as the wildest deeds of their knights-errant, a handful
      of men, señores, without clothes or food, almost without arms, left by
      their comrades on a deserted mountain-side to start on the conquest of one
      of the most powerful empires ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And among those men there was a Christobal de la Torre.... señor Don
      Marques, it is a glorious descent to claim.... And allow me to present
      myself: your servant Huayna Capac Buntu, head clerk of the Franco-Belgian
      Bank of Lima.... But we may fittingly travel in company, señor, for I am
      of royal blood. Huayna Capac, King of the Incas, who succeeded his father
      at the age of sixteen, married first Pillan Huaco, by whom he had no
      children. He then took two other wives, Bava-Bello and his cousin
      Mama-Buntu. I am the descendant of that Huayna Capac and that Mama-Buntu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now on leave from your bank?&rdquo; queried the Marquis, almost insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a flash in the Indian&rsquo;s eyes as he answered somberly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, on leave, for the Interaymi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick started at these words, already repeated so often in connection with
      the Golden Sun bracelet. He glanced at Maria-Teresa, who was evidently ill
      at ease at the turn taken by the conversation between her father and the
      stranger. She now remembered him quite clearly as a clerk with whom she
      had had dealings over a consignment of phosphates for Antwerp. An
      insignificant little body, she had thought&mdash;not at all the haughty
      Indian of to-day, discarding the disguise of his European clothes and
      proclaiming himself for what he was. Knowing by experience how susceptible
      Trujillos are, and fearing that a careless word from her father might
      provoke a storm, she intervened:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Interaymi! Of course, your great festival. Is it to be particularly
      celebrated at Cajamarca?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This year, señorita, it will be particularly celebrated throughout the
      Andes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do not admit outsiders? What a pity.... I should so like to
      see.... One hears so many things....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old wives&rsquo; tales, señorita,&rdquo; rejoined the Indian, with a complete change
      of manner. He smiled, disclosing a line of teeth which Dick mentally
      compared to those of a wild animal, and added in a slightly lisping voice:
      &ldquo;There is a lot of nonsense talked.... Human sacrifices, and so forth....
      Do I look as if I were going to such a ceremony?... I and my clothes by
      Zarate?... No, señorita, just a few little ceremonies to keep alive the
      memory of our lost glories... a few pious invocations to the God of Day, a
      few prayers for poor Atahualpa, our last King, and that is all.... At the
      end of the month, señorita, I shall be back at my bank in Lima.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reassured by the matter-of-fact level reached by these words, Dick growled
      at his own absurd fears. A smile from Maria-Teresa and a grumbled comment
      on kings and bank clerks from Uncle Francis completely dispelled the cloud
      raised by the mention of the Interaymi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their train was now traveling along the bed of a ravine, closed in by
      dizzying heights. High up above, in a band of blazing blue sky, giant
      condors could be seen winging their way in heavy circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think of Pizarro facing country like this!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick. &ldquo;How on
      earth was it that they were not simply wiped out by the Incas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They came as friends, señor,&rdquo; answered the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very fine, but still does not explain it How many men were
      there with Pizarro when he marched on Cajamarca?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had received reenforcements,&rdquo; interjected the Marquis, twisting his
      mustache, &ldquo;and there were then a hundred and seventy-seven of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minus nine,&rdquo; corrected the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, unless I am mistaken, only a hundred and sixty-eight,&rdquo; put in
      Uncle Francis, busy with his note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why minus nine?&rdquo; questioned Maria-Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, señorita,&rdquo; replied the descendant of Mama-Buntu, who seemed to
      know the history of the conquest of New Spain better than the descendants
      of the conquerors themselves, &ldquo;because Pizarro gave his new followers the
      same chance to draw back that the others had received. He had halted in
      the mountains to rest his band and make a careful inspection. As you have
      said, señor, they were then only a hundred and seventy-seven, including
      sixty-seven horse. There were only three arquebusiers, and a few
      crossbowmen&mdash;not more than twenty altogether. And with this band
      Pizarro was marching against an army of 50,000 men and against a nation of
      twenty millions! For, under the Incas, Peru included what are to-day
      called Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Chili. At this point, señores, he
      decided that his soldiers were still too many. He had noticed that some
      faces were dissatisfied, and, fearing that the discontent might spread, he
      decided to cut away the weak limbs before the gangrene reached the main
      body. Marshalling his men, he told them that they had reached a crisis in
      their fortunes&mdash;not a man must go on who doubted its ultimate
      success/ It was still not too late for waverers to return to San Miguel,
      where he had already left some of his companions. He was prepared to risk
      all with those who still wished to follow him. Nine men took advantage of
      Pizarro&rsquo;s offer&mdash;four infantrymen and five from the cavalry. The
      others stopped with their general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And cheered him to the echo at the call of Christobal de la Torre, who
      served the Conquistador like a brother!&rdquo; exclaimed the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know, we know!&rdquo; repeated the clerk. His tone roused the Marquis again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And might I ask why you are pleased to recall all these things?&rdquo; demanded
      Don Christobal haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To prove to you, señor, that the vanquished know the history of their
      country even better than the conquerors,&rdquo; retorted Runtu with an emphasis
      not a little ridiculous in a man of his dress and calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! How beautiful!&rdquo; exclaimed Maria-Teresa, anxious to divert their
      attention to the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their train was passing over a bridge from which a panorama of
      unparalleled beauty could be obtained. Before them stretched the giant
      chain of the Andes, peak heaped on peak. On one side, a rent in the ridges
      opened onto green forests, broken by little cultivated plateaus, each with
      its rustic cottage clinging to the rugged mountain-side And there, above,
      snowy crests sparkling in the sun&mdash;a chaos of savage magnificence and
      serene beauty to be found in no other mountain landscape of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost more terrible than beautiful, and as the train crossed abyss
      after abyss over quivering bridges, Maria-Teresa, clinging to Dick&rsquo;s arm,
      could not help murmuring: &ldquo;And even this did not daunt Pizarro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, she was overheard by the stranger, who took up the broken
      conversation with evident hostility:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could have crushed them easily, could we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis, turning superciliously, flicked the questioner&rsquo;s shoulder
      with his glove:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, pray, why did you not do so, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we, sir, were not traitors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick had only just time to stop the Marquis, who was on the point of
      rushing at the insolent Indian. Maria-Teresa, knowing her father&rsquo;s pride,
      calmed him in a moment by urging in an undertone that it would be
      ridiculous for a man of his rank and age to pay more attention to an
      Indian bank-clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; said Don Christobal with a gesture of contempt
      under which the Indian stood motionless as a statue. He had not been
      without guessing the sense of Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s remarks, and might have said
      more had not the stopping of the train definitely closed the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      The railway line, then still in course of construction, went no farther.
      The remaining thirty miles to Cajamarca had to be covered on mule-back,
      for they were still in the heart of the mountains, and the defiles were
      steep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too long a journey, however, for the tired travelers to undertake
      until the following morning. Clinging to the flanks of the rocks were a
      few rude sheds in which were lodged the men working on the line. Near by,
      surrounding a canteen, stood a dozen fairly comfortable tents, in which
      they themselves were to pass the night In a meager pasture just beyond,
      some thirty mules wandered at liberty, grazing. Above, the omnipresent
      galinagas flew in circles against a purple sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner, served on the brink of a chasm from which rose the mutter of the
      racing stream, was a gay meal. Buntu had vanished, and did not reappear
      until after nightfall, when Maria-Teresa met him near her tent. He was
      very apologetic, and, hat in hand, excused himself for the incident in the
      train. He had had no intention of being rude, and knowing that the Marquis
      was a great friend of the manager of the Franco-Belgian bank, he hoped
      that he would not carry the matter further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa, conquering a strong desire to laugh, promised the descendant
      of the Incas that he would not lose his clerkship through them. When he
      had bowed himself out of sight, she carried the story to her father and
      Dick, who were vastly amused. Then they all went to bed, with the
      exception of Uncle Francis, who passed the greater part of the night
      putting his notes in order and writing an article for a reverend monthly
      in which he re-told the story of the conquest of Peru, with the aid of the
      Last of the Incas. This Indian he sketched as a gloriously picturesque
      character, carefully omitting to say that he wore European clothes!
    </p>
    <p>
      As every night since the appearance of the three strange heads on her
      balcony Maria-Teresa found sleep with difficulty. To-night, though tired
      by the journey, she tossed restlessly on her narrow camp-bed. Suddenly, in
      the dead of night, she sat up, listening. A familiar voice seemed to be
      speaking. She slipped noiselessly to the canvas flap covering the entrance
      to the tent, and peeped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two shadows out there, moving away in the moonlight One she
      recognized immediately for the Indian bank-clerk. Who was the other? They
      stopped, and half turned toward the tent. It was Huascar!
    </p>
    <p>
      What was Huascar doing there, at that time of night, with that strange
      Indian? Why were they pointing at her tent? What did it all mean?... The
      two shadows were walking again.... Then the peace of the night was broken
      by a neigh, and the young girl saw a picketed horse stamping in the shadow
      beyond. Huascar vaulted into the saddle, while his companion loosed the
      picket-rope, still talking and occasionally nodding toward the tent. Then
      both disappeared, and silence descended again on the sleeping camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa could not sleep all night. Huascar&rsquo;s unexpected reappearance
      was in no way calculated to calm the half-expressed terror which haunted
      her, and which she refused to acknowledge, stifling what she called her
      cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she anything to fear from Huascar? She could not believe it. She knew
      quite well that the Indian loved her, but as a faithful dog does, she
      thought; and she felt certain that she could count on his devotion were
      she in any danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet! And yet!... And yet what? What danger could there be? It was too
      absurd! She was becoming as ridiculous as those two old ladies with their
      crazy legends! With that, she decided not to say a word to either Dick or
      her father. She was not going to be taken for a child afraid of every
      shadow it saw at night. But she would question Huayna Gapac Runtu on the
      very first occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This occasion presented itself during the first stage of the next day&rsquo;s
      journey. Maria-Teresa, the Marquis, Dick and old Montgomery led the way.
      Uncle Francis, at first delighted with the prospect of a mule-ride, soon
      determined to get off again. Riding along the very edge of precipices, his
      mount felt ten times too high, and he was sure that he would be safer on
      foot and, at certain times, on all-fours. He gradually became convinced
      that his mule would slip, and determined to dismount, at a point where two
      riders could not pass abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole cavalcade was thus stopped, while those behind called on the
      scientist to go ahead, and he vowed that he would do nothing of the kind,
      twisting in his saddle and trying to discover the best way to get off.
      Immediate action of the Indian bank-clerk saved the situation, and
      probably Uncle Francis&rsquo; neck. Getting off his own mule, Runtu squeezed
      down the line, and catching Mr. Montgomery&rsquo;s mount by the bridle, led it
      on to a broader path and safety. Dick, the Marquis and Maria-Teresa could
      not do less than thank him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they moved on, Maria-Teresa and the Indian were riding side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, señor Huayna Capae Runtu?&rdquo; she smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, señorita, let us forget all those illustrious names, which died with
      my ancestors. The only one I have a right to now is that by which I am
      known at the bank&mdash;just plain Oviedo, like everybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember now. That is what you called yourself when you came to me
      from the bank.... Well, señor Oviedo, can you tell me now what you were
      doing outside my tent last night with Huascar, my former servant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oviedo Huayna Capac Runtu did not budge, but his mule swerved slightly. He
      reined it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you saw Huascar, señorita? An old friend of mine. He arrived late at
      night, on his way to Cajamarca, and knowing I was at the camp, halted here
      a minute to see me. I remember now, we did stop outside your tents. When I
      told him you were there, he asked me to keep watch over you.... He went on
      immediately afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I need somebody to keep watch over me, then? Am I in any danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ordinary dangers of a journey like this. A mule may miss its footing,
      or a saddle may slip off. In either case, it spells death. That is what
      Huascar meant, and that is why I myself chose your mule and girthed it up
      this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too kind,&rdquo; said Maria-Teresa drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Uncle Francis drew level with them. He had recovered his
      equanimity with the wider path, and spoke casually of mountain dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I wonder how Pizarro managed to bring his
      little army through here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa threw him a look which, had he seen it, would have toppled
      the clumsy scientist into a ravine, mule and all. But he remained serenely
      unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is extraordinary,&rdquo; acquiesced Oviedo. &ldquo;I have made rather a study of
      it. At some points, the road was so steep that the horsemen had to
      dismount and almost drag their chargers after them. A single false step
      would have hurled them thousands of feet below. The defiles were then just
      practicable for the half-naked Indians, and think what it must have been
      for armored men, with the menace of an unknown enemy above them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what were the Indians doing all this time?&rdquo; asked Dick, approaching
      in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, señor... they were awaiting a visitor, not a foe.... Messages
      had been exchanged which....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One question,&rdquo; put in the Marquis&rsquo; voice. &ldquo;Do you suppose that if King
      Atahualpa had for one minute imagined his 50,000 men were incapable of
      defending him against a hundred and fifty Spaniards, that he would have
      behaved as he did? No, he merely felt contempt for their weakness. And he
      was wrong!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, señor, he was wrong.&rdquo; The bank-clerk bent his head humbly over his
      saddle-bow. Then, straightening himself again, he pointed to a peak
      towering above. &ldquo;He should have appeared in those defiles, like the
      horseman yonder, and all would have been finished. The Sun our God would
      still be reigning over the Empire of the Incas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words, the clerk seemed to have grown to a giant. His
      sweeping gesture took in the whole huge mass of the Andes, making of it a
      pedestal for the Indian above them, sitting motionless on his horse, and
      watching their caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huascar!&rdquo; exclaimed Maria-Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      All recognized Huascar. From that moment, until they had left the first
      chain of the Andes behind them, that silhouette of horse and man dominated
      and haunted them&mdash;sometimes behind, sometimes before, but always
      above them:&mdash;a promise of protection, or a menace.

      II
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter another night
      in camp, the travelers came in sight of the beautiful valley of Cajamarca,
      smiling below them in striking contrast to the somber mountains around.
      Thus did this happy valley appear to the astonished eyes of Pizarro&rsquo;s men.
      It was inhabited in the days of the Conquistador by a race far superior to
      those with which the Spaniards had met on the other side of the mountains,
      as was clearly shown by the taste of their clothes, the cleanliness and
      comfort of their homes. As far as the eye could reach was a prosperous
      plain, watered by a wide river, abundantly irrigated by canals and
      subterranean aqueducts, broken up by green hedges and well-cultivated
      fields; for the ground was rich, and the temperate climate favorable to
      farming. Immediately below the adventurers lay the little city of
      Cajamarca, its white houses twinkling in the sunlight, like a precious
      stone shining in the dark girdle of the Sierra.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a league beyond, in the valley, Pizarro could see columns of steam
      rising to the sky, and showing the position of the famous hot baths of the
      princes of Peru.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also a spectacle far less pleasing to the Spaniards. The lower
      mountain slopes disappeared under a cloud of white tents, covering an area
      of several miles. &ldquo;We were amazed,&rdquo; wrote one of the conquerors, &ldquo;to find
      the Indians holding so proud a position, and this sight threw confusion,
      and even fear, into the staunchest hearts. But it was too late to turn, or
      to show the slightest weakness, and after carefully exploring the ground,
      we put on the best faces that we could, and prepared to enter Caxamarxa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flowing over with such memories, and wild with excitement at finding
      himself in a land which he knew so well by hearsay, Uncle Francis stood up
      in his stirrups, and held forth interminably on the Cajamarca of his
      dreams. Instructed by Oviedo Runtu, he showed them the exact spot where
      Atahualpa and his 50,000 warriors had awaited Pizarro. Uncle Francis
      himself felt no fear of this huge army, massed in the hidden fastnesses of
      a continent discovered by Christopher Columbus just forty years before
      Pizarro&rsquo;s wild venture. He felt like a hero of antiquity, and was quite
      ready to give the order to charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nobody there to tell them, though, what were the feelings of the
      Peruvian monarch when he saw the warlike band of Christians, banners
      flying, corselets and morions gleaming, debouch from the dark defile and
      advance into the rolling domains which until then no white man had ever
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Uncle Francis&rsquo; mule bolted, and a burst of laughter went up from
      the whole party. Excited by the shouts and cries, the other mules followed
      their leader, helter-skelter down the incline. The obvious dénouement was
      not long in coming. Uncle Francis&rsquo; mount, in a desperate effort to get
      away from the noise behind, rolled over, and the unfortunate scientist
      described a neat somersault. He was on his feet again almost at once, and
      soon set his anxious companions at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus it was,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;that Pizarro won his first battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa and Dick appearing disposed to listen, he explained that in
      the Conquistador&rsquo;s first fight with Incas, before he crossed the Andes,
      the little band of Spaniards, hard pressed, was saved by one hidalgo being
      unhorsed. The Incas, knowing nothing of horses or horsemanship, were so
      frightened that they fled, not daring to face this extraordinary animal
      which became two and still went on fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, nobody believed him, though he was in no way drawing on his
      imagination. The whole story of the conquest of Peru is so extraordinary
      that one must forgive incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      These facts, however, are vouched for by well-authenticated documents in
      the Royal Archives at Madrid, which Uncle Francis had taken care to study
      before starting for the Americas with his nephew. They were still laughing
      at his adventure and his story when their cavalcade reached the walls of
      Cajamarca.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nightfall as they entered the city. The first thing to arrest their
      attention was the enormous number of Indians in the streets, and their
      silence. Cajamarca, with a normal population of between twelve and
      thirteen thousand, certainly sheltered twice as many souls that night. And
      still more people were coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the highroad, the Marquis&rsquo; party had successively passed file after
      file of Indians, plodding in the direction of their Sacred City. For
      Cajamarca may be called the necropolis of the Incas, and one can hardly
      take a step in its streets or avenues without meeting with some reminder
      of the splendor of a vanished empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to see, by the manner of the Quichuas crowding the historic
      roadways, that a religious pilgrimage had brought together this mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amazement of the travelers, however, was as nothing to that of the
      inhabitants themselves, who had never before witnessed such an invasion.
      In the memory of living man, the Interaymi had never visibly moved the
      multitude in this manner. Even the great decennial fête had been rather
      the occasion for a general disappearance of Indians than for their
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did it all mean? The authorities were distinctly ill at ease, and the
      few troops massed at Cajamarca when the news came in of Garcia&rsquo;s Indian
      revolt at the other end of the country had been put under arms. The doors
      of the city&rsquo;s eight churches were militarily guarded, for each one of
      these buildings might have made a fortress. The rest of the troops had
      been gathered in the main square, not far from the ruined palace in which
      stands the stone on which Atahualpa, last King of the Incas, was burned
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      These ruins were the goal of the Indians&rsquo; long pilgrimage over the
      mountains, the visit to that stone being the religious and outward pretext
      for this mute manifestation by a conquered race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal, amazed at what he saw, nervously remembered that the great
      Indian revolt of 1818 had been preceded by just such happenings. Were the
      Interaymi festivals which began next day really to be the signal for one
      of those revolts which the governments of Peru had long decided were no
      more to be feared?
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was putting this question to himself, the Marquis caught sight of
      the post-office, and immediately dismounted. Dick and Maria-Teresa
      exchanged a smile. They were at last to know the name of the facetious
      sender of the Golden Sun bracelet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They pulled up their mules, and waited with an indifferent air that was
      perhaps a little affected. Ten minutes later the Marquis came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the name and address,&rdquo; he said in a puzzled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the name?&rdquo; questioned Maria-Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Atahualpa,&rdquo; replied her father, mounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the jest continues.&rdquo;&mdash;Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s voice had changed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently so. The clerk who received the parcel says it was brought in
      by an Indian, who said his name really was Atahualpa. That, after all, is
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as you have the address, we might pay him a little call,&rdquo; suggested
      Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what I was going to say.&rdquo; And Don Christobal turned his mule.
      Uncle Francis brought up the rear, vigorously taking notes, with his book
      resting on the pommel of the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed a rivulet racing towards an affluent of the upper Maranon,
      passed San Francisco, the first Christian church built in Peru, and, after
      the Marquis had asked his way several times, finally reached a square
      teeming with Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one side of this square still stood ancient palace walls. There had
      been the last home of the last Inca King. There he had lived in splendor,
      and there he died a martyr. There had been the home of Atahualpa, and
      there had the post-office clerk directed Don Christobal de la Torre!

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>aken in the swirl
      of the crowd, the little cavalcade was gradually headed toward the ruined
      palace, and forced through its huge gates almost before the Marquis&rsquo; party
      knew what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now in a vast courtyard packed with Indians. Some of them,
      standing erect, showed the proud foreheads of chiefs, but the great
      majority were prostrate round a stone in the center&mdash;the stone of the
      martyrdom of Atahualpa.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the far side of this stone, standing on a rude bench, was a man draped
      in a poncho of vivid red.... He was speaking in Quichua, while the crowd
      listened in reverent silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the party of strangers rode into the courtyard, a sharp voice behind
      them interrupted the psalm-like recitation of the man in the red poncho.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak Spanish, and everybody will understand,&rdquo; it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis and Maria-Teresa turned. Behind them was their bank-clerk
      traveling companion, bowing as if to make them understand that he had
      intervened to do them a favor. Extraordinarily enough, this interruption,
      almost sacrilegious as it was, did not stir a man. The Indian in the red
      poncho paused for a moment, and continued in Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In those days,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Inca was all-powerful, and a vast army
      bowed to his will. The city was surrounded by a triple wall of stone, in
      the heart of which stood the citadel and the home of the Virgins of the
      Sun. The Inca, knowing no fear, and ignorant of all treason, allowed the
      white men to enter the city and received them as friends, as envoys from
      that other great emperor beyond the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the leader of the Strangers, doubting the generous heart of the Inca,
      had divided his army into three bands, marching toward the city in battle
      array. Then the Inca said, &lsquo;Since they fear our hospitality, let us all
      leave the city, so that peace may enter their hearts.&rsquo; Thus it was that
      when the Conquistador rode through our streets, he met not a living soul,
      and heard no sound but the stamp of his own warriors&rsquo; feet.&rdquo; Here the
      speaker stopped, as if to gather his thoughts, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was at a late hour in the afternoon. The Stranger then sent an
      ambassador to the Inca&rsquo;s camp. He sent his brother, Fernando, and twenty
      horsemen. The Inca received Fernando on his throne, his forehead adorned
      with the royal borla. He was surrounded by his officers and wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Strangers came with words of honey, and the Inca replied: &lsquo;Tell your
      leader that I am fasting until to-morrow. Then will I and my chiefs visit
      him. Until then, I allow him to occupy the public buildings on the square,
      but no others. I will decide to-morrow what is meet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it happened that after these good words, a Spaniard, to thank the
      Inca, put his horse through its paces, for the prince who had never seen
      such an animal. And several of those present having shown fear, while the
      Inca himself remained impassible, the Inca ordered them to be put to
      death, as was just. Then the ambassadors drank chicha in golden vases
      brought to them by the Virgins of the Sun, and returned to Cajamarca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they told their leader of what they had seen, the splendor of the
      Inca&rsquo;s camp, the number of his troops, despair entered the soldiers&rsquo;
      hearts. At night they saw the Inca&rsquo;s camp-fires lighting up the
      mountain-sides, and blazing in the darkness like a multitude of stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian paused again, then went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Stranger, intent on evil, went among his men spreading the
      shameful words which gave them new courage. The next day, at noon, the
      Inca&rsquo;s bodyguard advanced toward the city. The King could be seen above
      the multitude, carried on the shoulders of his princes. Behind him, the
      ranks of his own soldiers stretched as far as the eye could reach. The
      city was silent, save for the cry of the sentinels on the citadel walls,
      reporting the movements of the Inca&rsquo;s army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First there entered into the city three hundred servitors, chanting songs
      of triumph to the glory of the Inca. Then came warriors, guards, lords
      adorned with silver, copper, and gold. Our Atahualpa, Son of the Sun, was
      borne above all on a throne of massive gold. Now, when Atahualpa, with six
      thousand men, had reached the great square without seeing a single white
      man, he asked: &lsquo;Where are the strangers?&rsquo; And a monk, whom none had seen
      until then, approached the Inca, a cross in his hand. With the monk was an
      interpreter of our race. The Inca listened while the priest told him of
      his religion and urged him to abandon the faith of his fathers for that of
      the Christian. Atahualpa replied: &lsquo;Your God was put to death by the men to
      whom he gave life. But mine lives still in the Heavens, and shines upon
      his children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, the Indians surrounding the little band of Europeans
      turned toward the sun, just about to vanish behind the Andes, uttering a
      strange cry, a cry of mingled farewell and hope handed down by generations
      as the salutation of their faith to the God of Day. Above the reverently
      bowed throng, a purple sky awaited the coming of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was so grandiose that Dick and Maria-Teresa could not restrain a
      movement of admiration. There could be no doubt of it: the Sun god still
      had his true worshipers, as in the tragic days of Atahualpa. To know it,
      one had only to look at this trembling mass of men, who had kept their
      language and their traditions through so many centuries. They had been
      vanquished, but not conquered. Perhaps it was true after all that back
      there in the mountains, in some city unknown to all but themselves,
      guarded by the rampart of the Andes and the eternal snows, there lived
      priests who passed their lives feeding the sacred fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      After their salutation to the Sun, the Indians resumed their kneeling
      posture, many, strangely enough, making the sign of the cross as they bent
      to the ground. Where did that sign come from? Was it only another instance
      of the extraordinary mingling of cults and creeds so often seen, or did it
      go even further back? Historians there are who say that the conquerors
      found it already used by the Incas. Did some early Christian adventurers,
      then, found the twin empires of the Americas? While Uncle Francis dreamed
      on, lost in such conjectures, the priest in the red poncho, took up the
      broken thread of his narration:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pizarro and his men, armed for battle, were hiding in the halls of the
      vast palace surrounding the square. There the monk who had spoken to
      Atahualpa rejoined the Stranger, and said to him: &lsquo;Do you not see that we
      wrestle in vain with this dog&rsquo;s pride? His troops are coming up by the
      thousand. Strike while it is not too late!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence became, if possible, more intense. The man in red, about to
      tell of what he called the Crime of the Stranger, straightened himself on
      his pedestal till he dominated the whole assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;St. James and at them!&rsquo; With that accursed battle-cry, Pizarro&rsquo;s men
      hurled themselves on the Inca and his guard. Horse and foot charged out of
      the palace in which they had been hidden, smashing in the indian ranks. A
      terrible panic seized Atahut and his followers, who fled in all
      directions. Nobles and servants, princes and guards, fled before the
      terrible horsemen, who trampled down all before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They made no resistance. They could not, for they were unarmed. Nor could
      they flee, for all the doors and streets were barred by the corpses of
      those trampled to death in a vain effort to escape. So terrible was the
      press, the whirling swords driving our people ever further back, that one
      wall of the square fell. Hundreds fled through this opening and scattered
      in all directions, the Spanish horse in pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Atahualpa&rsquo;s throne, borne hither and thither in the crowd, was finally
      reached by the Spaniards. He would have been killed there and then had not
      Pizarro intervened. In doing so, he was wounded in the hand by one of his
      own men. The nobles carrying the royal litter were cut down, and the Inca
      was seized by Pizarro. A soldier named Estete tore the borla from his
      forehead, and the captured monarch was conducted to a hall near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the capture of the Inca, all resistance ceased. The news spread
      through the country like wildfire, and all thought of real resistance was
      gone. Even the thousands of soldiers encamped round the city took fright,
      and scattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only being which might have kept the Indians united was cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That night, the Inca supped with Pizarro. He showed surprising courage,
      and remained impassible throughout the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day, the sack of the city began. Never had the Spaniards seen so
      much gold and silver. Atahualpa, quick to see their greed, offered Pizarro
      to buy his liberty by covering with gold the floor of the room in which
      they were. Finally, he declared that he would not only cover the floor,
      but also fill the room as high as he could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that, he made a mark on the wall with his fingertip; and Pizarro,
      accepting, ordered a red line to be drawn round the room at that height.
      The room was seventeen feet by twenty-two long, and the line was drawn
      nine feet from the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point, the red priest stopped and walked slowly to a ruined wall.
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a still faintly visible line, &ldquo;was the mark
      of the ransom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Atahualpa, moreover, promised to fill a neighboring room with silver, and
      asked for two months in which to fulfil the task. His messengers, chosen
      among the Spaniards&rsquo; prisoners, were despatched into all the provinces of
      the Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, the Inca was closely watched, for his captivity meant not only
      Pizarro&rsquo;s security, but also fabulous riches for the Conquistadors. The
      room filled gradually, Indians arriving daily with golden goblets,
      platters, vases and bar gold to lay at the feet of their prisoned ruler.
      On some days, we are told, as much as 60,000 pesos of booty was brought
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hasten the gathering of the ransom, Pizarro sent his brother Fernando
      to Cuzco, the greatest city of the Incas. With them went a messenger from
      Atahualpa, at whose orders the priests stripped the Temple of the Sun, and
      the inhabitants gave up every scrap of precious metal in their possession.
      Fernando brought back with him, besides a mass of silver, 200 full loads
      of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now faced with the problem of taking his plunder from the country,
      Pizarro ordered the melting-down of the hundreds of objects massed in the
      treasure-room. The finest pieces sent from temples and palaces were set
      aside for Charles V., to show the Emperor what a wonderful land had been
      added to his possession&mdash;all the rest was to be reduced to ingots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The native jewelers, obeying Atahualpa, worked night and day for a month
      to carry out this task. When the ingots were weighed, the Spaniards found
      that they had gold to the value of 1,326,539 pesos de oro. This would
      mean, in modern currency, and taking into consideration the altered value
      of money, more than three and a half millions sterling, or close on
      fifteen and a half million dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now that the ransom had been paid, Atahualpa was not set at liberty.
      His captors accused him of fomenting a rebellion against Charles V., and
      threatened him with death. Atahualpa replied: &ldquo;&lsquo;Am I not a poor prisoner
      in your hands? Why should I do so, knowing that I should be the first to
      suffer if my people rose? And unless I give the order, none will raise a
      hand against you. Even the birds in my states hardly dare fly against my
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his protestations of innocence had little effect. Pizarro&rsquo;s men were
      convinced that a general rising was being prepared. Patrols were doubled,
      and every man of the little army slept under arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pizarro did all he could, or pretended to do all he could, to save the
      Inca&rsquo;s life, but in vain. His followers demanded it, and Atahualpa,
      brought to trial, was found guilty and sentenced to be burned alive. On
      the 29th of August, 1533, his fate was proclaimed in the great square of
      the city to the sound of bugles, and two hours after sunset he was taken
      to the stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Atahualpa left this hall loaded with chains! He passed through this door
      on his way to martyrdom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again the red priest left his rude rostrum, walking here and there
      through the crowd, evoking by deed as well as word the last hours of the
      last Inca. The silence was intense, and his voice, alternately grave and
      impassioned, rang out like a clarion note.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sad story, the Indian orator had omitted all that showed, the
      immense courage of the Conquistadors and the cowardice of the Inca&rsquo;s
      followers. Everything was attributed to the treachery of the Spaniards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Atahualpa died at the stake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Menacing and prophetic, the priest turned toward the spot where Christobal
      de la Torre and his companions, hemmed in by the crowd, had listened, as
      motionless as any of the faithful present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I say unto you, cursed be all the sons of those who came to us with a
      lie in their hearts! They shall die like dogs, and never know the blessed
      palaces of the Sun. They shall die unblessed, the liars who say that
      Atahualpa abjured his faith! The Son of the Sun remained true to the God
      of Day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a threatening murmur in the crowd. Round the Sacred Stone, it
      grew to a roar. How dared those strangers come there at such a time?
      Centuries of slavery can never bend backs so low that they will not
      straighten at certain hours. The descendant of Christobal de la Torre had
      met one of those hours.

      IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>en, women and
      children began to press toward the group of riders. Dick, first to realize
      the change in the humor of the mob, spurred alongside Maria-Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get out of this! Steady, and forward all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis, superbly cool, followed as if reluctant to show his back to
      any horde of Indians. The menace in the voices grew clearer. He looked
      round him, and drove his spurs home, till his mount reared and plunged
      into the crowd, clearing a space around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mob was howling now, and knives were being drawn on all sides, when a
      giant Indian pushed his way toward the Spaniards. Maria-Teresa, Don
      Christobal and Dick recognized Huascar, before whom his countrymen made
      way with evident respect and dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back!&rdquo; he shouted, taking the young girl&rsquo;s mule by the bridle. &ldquo;Who
      touches the Virgin of the Sun is a dead man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, the crowd parted. Silence succeeded the tumult of a moment
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the strangers pass,&rdquo; ordered Huascar, and himself escorted them to
      the ancient palace gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, on the plaza, they met a police patrol. The sergeant, in
      undertaking to escort them to the inn, was eloquent on their imprudence in
      coming into a quarter peopled by fanatical Indians on the eve of the
      Interaymi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis wished to thank Huascar, but the Indian had vanished.
      Maria-Teresa and Dick, both very white, had not a word to say. Uncle
      Francis was also dumb, and did not take a single note.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the inn they found only one vacant room, in which they all gathered.
      Dick was the first to utter the thought which was worrying them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose it was true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, suppose it was true!&rdquo; repeated Maria-Teresa,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Suppose what was true?&rdquo; demanded the Marquis, refusing to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Virgin of the Sun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all silent for a moment, bent under the weight of one amazing,
      absurd, monstrous thought. And they exchanged anxious, frightened looks,
      like children who are being told some terrifying fairy-tale. Dick broke
      the spell:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard what Huascar said. &lsquo;Who touches the Virgin of the Sun is a dead
      man!&rsquo; Those were his own words!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a manner of speech,&rdquo; hesitated Uncle Francis. &ldquo;It cannot be anything
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else? What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the Marquis violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it could not be... the other thing. If Maria-Teresa was... was the
      Virgin of the Sun, they would not have let her pass out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we all going mad! After all, we are masters here!&rdquo; burst out Don
      Christobal. &ldquo;There are the police, and the troops. All those rascals out
      there are our slaves. &lsquo;Pon my soul, we are all raving!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; exclaimed Maria-Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, I think we ought to get out of Cajamarca as soon as we
      can,&rdquo; said Dick, going to the window and looking out. Night had fallen, and
      with it silence. The square outside was deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a knock at the door, and a servant brought in a letter
      addressed to Maria-Teresa. She tore it open and read aloud:&mdash;&ldquo;Return
      to Lima at once. Leave Cajamarca tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not signed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but this warning comes from Huascar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we should follow his advice,&rdquo; said Dick. There was another knock at
      the door. This time, it announced the arrival of the Chief of Police, who
      was anxious to know what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard of the incident at Atahualpa&rsquo;s palace, and had moreover been
      warned by an Indian, an employee at the Franco-Belgian bank at Lima, that
      it might be dangerous for the Marquis and his companions to show
      themselves in the streets on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was obvious that the man feared trouble, and would have given anything
      to see the party a hundred miles away. When he learned that they were
      ready to leave at once, he busied himself about finding them fresh mules
      and a guide, and furthermore detailed four troopers to escort the party as
      far as the railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cajamarca was left at eleven o&rsquo;clock that night, and the return journey
      was made at double the speed at which they had come. Dick would let nobody
      rest, and forced the pace throughout. It was not until the following
      night, safe in the train for Pascamayo, that they realized the ridicule
      that attached to their hasty flight. &ldquo;Just like a pack of children
      frightened out of their lives by Agnes&rsquo; stories,&rdquo; said the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in civilized life again, they were all surprised at their panic.
      After all, the whole thing could be so naturally explained&mdash;fanatics
      resenting the presence of strangers at a religious festival, and nothing
      more. The best thing they could do was to forget it as soon as possible.
      Uncle Francis restored the party&rsquo;s gaiety by going through the same
      performance which he had rehearsed on landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forty-eight hours in Lima completely dispelled the cobwebs. Maria-Teresa
      found a great deal of work awaiting her, and forgot her fears in a maze of
      figures which took her to Callao early, and kept her busy at the offices
      until late in the afternoon, when Dick came to fetch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, about eight days after the adventure at Cajamarca, the tap
      at her window which announced Dick&rsquo;s arrival came earlier than usual.
      Maria-Teresa got up, and threw open the shutters. Dick was not there....
      Then she retreated with a half-strangled scream. Was it possible? In the
      rapidly gathering darkness, she could not be sure, and leaned out of the
      window to see better.... That thing, swaying in the darkness, looked just
      like the sugar-loaf skull.... She retreated into the room, trembling in
      every limb, and turned round. From the dark corners of the chamber two
      other shadows, the valise and cap skulls, were advancing slowly, swaying
      as they came.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, Maria-Teresa thought she had lost her reason. Then she made
      a violent effort to regain control of herself. Dead skulls could not come
      to life like this. And yet, they were coming toward her, swaying horribly,
      above shadowy bodies! A desperate scream for help was choked in her
      throat. &ldquo;Dick!...&rdquo; and nothing more. The three living skulls had hurled
      themselves upon her, gagged her, and now, throwing the inanimate girl over
      their shoulders, hurried through the black hole of the open window.
      Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s own motor was waiting there, her negro boy at the wheel,
      smiling strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their mummy hands, horribly living, lifted the girl into the tonneau, and
      the three monsters, like three larvae, climbed in after her. Then the car
      shot down the street.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>eanwhile, Dick,
      wandering through Callao until the time came to call for Maria-Teresa, was
      strolling up the Calle de Lima. He had just come from the Darsena docks,
      where the harbor engineers had been giving him news the reverse of
      cheerful. In the present condition of the country, they said, any venture
      in the deserted gold-mines of the Cuzco was hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last two days had brought news of fighting from the other end of the
      country. Or, at all events, cartridges were being used up, even if there
      was no attendant damage. Everybody had thought Garcia feasting at
      Arequipa, but the pretender had evaded his enemies and attacked the
      Republican forces between Sicuani and the Cuzco. It was even rumored that
      Cuzco itself had fallen into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were all this true, the outlook for Dick&rsquo;s affairs was bad. His company,
      thanks to the influence of the Marquis de la Torre, had obtained a
      concession from President Veintemilla, This would not be worth the paper
      it was written on if Garcia proved victorious. Super-active by nature, the
      young engineer could not endure the thought of the long months of enforced
      idleness before him until the revolution had been settled in one way or
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came into the Calle de Lima, Dick pulled out his watch. He found
      that he still had a few minutes to spare. Much as she loved him,
      Maria-Teresa did not like being interrupted at her work, so he turned into
      the Circulo de los Amigos de las Artes for a drink. This establishment,
      though baptized a club, was in reality a huge café and reading-room. The
      ground floor was packed with people discussing the latest events. Cuzco
      was in every mouth, and it was noticeable that Veintemilla&rsquo;s warmest
      partizans now had a good word to say for Garcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stampede of shock-headed newsboys, shouting the latest edition of an
      official paper, tore past the café, scattering still wet sheets and
      collecting coppers. One of the customers climbed onto a table and read out
      a proclamation by the President, urging calm and giving a categorical
      denial to the report of the capture of Cuzco. General Garcia and his
      troops, the President announced, were bottled up in Arequipa, all the
      sierra defiles were in the hands of Government troops, and the traitors
      would be hurled into the sea or chased into the great sand deserts. The
      proclamation concluded with a reference to Indian troubles in the suburbs,
      attributing them to the usual Interaymi effervescence, and dismissing them
      as negligible. Cheers for the President ended the reading of his
      manifesto. Wavering allegiances were at once restored, and it was
      generally agreed that his statement was superb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick left the café a little happier, though he did not really place a
      great deal of faith in the official denial. Night had fallen and he walked
      briskly, now fearing that he might be late. As he went, he remembered his
      first day&rsquo;s walk through this same labyrinth of narrow streets. Then he
      caught sight of his fiancée&rsquo;s verandah in the distance, and noticed that
      the window was open, as on the first day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she sat, the little business-woman, with her brass-covered green
      registers. What a manly little brain it was! And to think that the pair of
      them had been such fools over that Golden Sun bracelet... Something to
      laugh about in after years, that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, and Dick walked up to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still no answer. He peered into the room, trying to see where she was
      hiding. Nobody there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked into the room. There could be no doubt of it. That table knocked
      down, those books on the floor, that curtain torn from its rings, this
      broken pane in the window told the story. Silence greeted his shout for
      help. Not a servant, not a soul in the place, and all the doors open!
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa! Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly knowing what he did, Dick ran into the deserted courtyard, and then
      back into the office. There could be no doubt of it. Huascar and his
      Indians had carried her off. That dog Huascar, whom she trusted, and who
      loved her, not as a dog should, but as if he were a man. Horror-stricken,
      furious, Dick searched the room for some clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scoundrels! He swore aloud as he pictured Maria-Teresa struggling in
      Huascar&rsquo;s arms and calling for help in vain. That was where he should have
      been, instead of listening to all those fools in the café. He could have
      laid his hands on Huascar then! That was the man they should have watched
      instead of being thrown off the scent by all those wild-cat legends about
      the Bride of the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Indian in love with a white girl and thirsting for revenge! Of course!
      He saw it all now, and remembered how Huascar had last left that same
      room, driven out by Maria-Teresa. The insolent dog, with his fist raised
      in menace!
    </p>
    <p>
      As idea after idea swept across his brain, Dick stared helplessly at the
      blank walls about him. What could he do? He jumped back into the street
      and hesitated. No clue here&mdash;only the doors of closed stores and
      sightless walls&mdash;a pit of gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he heard voices, and leaped into action. At the corner of the
      street there, under that lantern, was a wine-shop, the only living thing
      in this dead street. He ran toward it, kicked the door open, and almost
      fell on top of Domingo, the night watchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Domingo, taken aback, mumbled indistinctly. He thought that the señorita
      had returned to Lima as usual with the señor. The motor had gone by just a
      little while ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What motor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Domingo shrugged his shoulders. There were not so many motors as all that
      in Callao and Lima.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was driving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Libertad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Si, señor, Libertad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say anything to you as he went past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, señor, he did not see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see your mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hood was up, señor, and the motor was traveling fast.... Nay,
      señor!... That is the truth. I swear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick seized the man by the collar, and shook him like a rat
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you doing here? Why were you not with your mistress, at your
      post?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant no harm, señor. A Quichua offered me a drink here... real pisco,
      señor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick, without listening, dragged the protesting man through the streets
      and into the empty office. When he realized what had happened, Domingo
      would have torn his hair out with grief, but Dick, seizing him by the
      throat, drove him to the wall and looked into his eyes. A fool or a
      traitor, which was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Told to speak, and speak quickly, Domingo answered Dick&rsquo;s volley of
      questions without a minute&rsquo;s hesitation. The señorita could not have been
      carried off without the aid of Libertad, a rascally half-breed to whom
      the señorita had given work out of pity. The day and hour had been chosen
      by some one who knew the place well, for on Saturday afternoons there were
      no workmen or clerks on the premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you went out to drink, was the motor already waiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, señor. It had been there half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the hood up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, señor. Libertad was sitting in it alone.&rdquo; Releasing his grip, Dick
      dashed into the street again and started running toward the main avenue.
      If Maria-Teresa had been carried off in her own motor, it would be easy to
      trace her part of the way. As Domingo had said, there were not so many
      cars about.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he dashed round a corner, Dick came into sharp collision with a man
      emerging from a doorway, who swore vigorously. Dick recognized him at
      once, and gave such a shout that the chief of police, for it was he, fell
      into a posture of defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, señor.... I am Dick Montgomery... the fiancé of Señorita de
      la Torre.... She has been carried off by the Indians!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doña Maria-Teresa? That is not possible!&rdquo; In a few words, Dick told the
      little old gentleman what had happened, and gave him his suspicions. He
      found ready sympathy and belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on my way to dine with a friend just opposite. A minute while I
      tell them that I cannot come, and I am with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried across the street while Dick, with an indignant snort, moved on
      toward the harbor, questioning shopkeepers and pedestrians as he went. So
      far as he could gather, the motor had about half-an-hour&rsquo;s start of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick was convinced that he had seen the last of the Chief of Police. In
      this he did the little man an injustice, for he had hardly gone two
      hundred yards before he heard footsteps behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not wait, señor? Well, here I am. Natividad is always to be
      counted upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though his real name was Perez, the Chief of Police was known throughout
      the city as Natividad, a nickname earned him by his cherubic face, and of
      which he was rather proud. Dick found the little man hot enough against
      the Indians even for his taste. Natividad hated the Quichuas, and believed
      them capable of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before they reached the harbor, at the corner of the narrow Calle de
      San Lorenzo, Natividad seized Dick by the arm and drew him to the wall.
      The street was deserted, and lighted only by feeble rays from a low
      glass-paned door a few steps ahead. This door had just been opened, and a
      man peered out cautiously. Dick stifled a desire to shout. He had
      recognized Huascar!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian whistled, and two shadows, wearing wide-brimmed Indian
      sombreros, detached themselves from the wall at the other end of the
      street. They rejoined Huascar, who had closed the door behind him, and
      exchanged a few rapid words. Then the two walked off in the direction of
      the harbor, and Huascar disappeared as he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natividad, pressed against the wall, held Dick&rsquo;s hand in a grip that
      imposed silence. &ldquo;Why is it? What does it mean? Perhaps she is in there,&rdquo;
       the young man whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signing the engineer to stop talking, Natividad crept toward the door, and
      at the risk of being discovered, peeped through the uncurtained panes.
      Dick, looking over his shoulder, saw a room full of Indians sitting at
      tables, but neither smoking nor drinking. Huascar was walking up and down
      between the tables, in deep thought Then he vanished up a staircase
      leading to some room on the first floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natividad had apparently seen enough, for he dragged Dick into the shadow
      of a neighboring porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot make it out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What are they all doing here during the
      Interaymi? I thought every Quichua in the city had left for the mountains.
      There should not be one here for the next ten days. But I cannot believe
      Huascar has anything to do with the kidnaping. He wouldn&rsquo;t tell his secret
      to all the Indians of Peru, when he knows that nearly every one of them
      can be bought for a few centavo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait before you make up your mind. We can at all events find the motor. I
      am sure Huascar knows where Maria-Teresa is. We must not lose sight of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not have to wait long,&rdquo; replied Natividad, stiffening at a fresh
      noise from the other end of the calle. &ldquo;Here are those Indians coming back
      with horses.... What does it mean?... Madré de Dios!... Is it possible?...
      The Interaymi!... Silence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clatter of hoofs on the cobbled roadway showed that quite a strong
      cavalcade was approaching, and the watchers drew back farther to the
      shelter of an alley nearly opposite the low door, and from which they
      could still see all that was happening round it. As the cavalcade rode up,
      the door opened again, showing all the Indians standing up, and apparently
      waiting for somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huascar appeared first; after him an Indian whom Dick recognized at once
      for the Red Preacher of Cajamarca; lastly a man in a lounge-suit of
      impeccable cut:&mdash;Oviedo Huayna Runtu himself. Then an incredible
      thing happened. All these men who had remained motionless before Huascar
      and the priest bent on their knees, humbled their heads to the ground
      before the bank-clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troop of horses and mules had halted before the low door, and men with
      lanterns came out of the house. The bank-clerk was the first to vault into
      the saddle, Huascar holding his stirrup. Then Huascar and the Cajamarca
      priest mounted, ranging themselves on each side of the leader, but just
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huascar turned in his saddle and made a sign. Every Indian in the party
      threw open his poncho, showing beneath it, in the light of the lanterns,
      another cloak of brilliant red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Red Ponchos!&rdquo; gasped Natividad, grasping Dick&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a whistle at the end of the street, answered by another a long
      way off, at the other end of the Darsena quay,... and the cavalcade
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick made as if to follow, but Natividad held him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, and listen! We must know which way they are going!&rdquo;
     </p>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span> unched forward,
      he listened, then turned to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chorillos road. Unless I am much mistaken, they are following the
      motor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on; we must get after them! Where can we get horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me. We can do better than that. We have the telephone and the
      railway.&rdquo; And once again he took up his litany:&mdash;&ldquo;The Red Ponchos!
      The Red Ponchos!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?... Red or gray, it&rsquo;s all one.... Those men
      belong to Huascar&rsquo;s band, and helped him.... That seems pretty clear to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, quite right. I agree with you now, young sir,&rdquo; replied
      Natividad, puffing by Dick&rsquo;s side as they hurried toward the railway
      station. &ldquo;Yes, indeed. They are all in it.... The Red Ponchos.... The
      Priests of the Sun.&rdquo; Dick stopped dead. Natividad&rsquo;s last words at last
      made him understand. He remembered, in a flash, all the legends told by
      Aunt Agnes and old Irene. And they had seen fit to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he groaned, and began running again. As he ran, he shouted to
      his companion:&mdash;&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll catch them yet, and you&rsquo;ll arrest them
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do what I can. But there are at least thirty of them, and there
      are not enough troops in Callao to send a squadron in pursuit.... Every
      soldier the city could spare has been sent into the sierra against
      Garcia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can telephone to Lima.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll take me for a madman, as they did ten years ago,&rdquo; replied
      Natividad enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will we get to Chorillos before them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a train in ten minutes&rsquo; time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me we would have done better to follow on horseback. Then we
      could have found out where they were going. Thirty of them, are there?
      Only damned Indians, though. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind tackling the lot myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way is the best....&rdquo; And Natividad added in an undertone: &ldquo;They
      wouldn&rsquo;t believe me ten years ago. Well, it&rsquo;s beginning again.&rdquo; Dick,
      intent on reaching the railway station, did not hear him. He could only
      think of those mysterious Indians on the highroad out there. &ldquo;We shall
      lose their track,&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not fear that,&rdquo; replied the Chief of Police. &ldquo;Their road runs
      alongside the railway line. If we see a motor waiting on it, we stop the
      train. If we overhaul the Red Ponchos alone, we go on to Chorillos, and
      wait for them there. I&rsquo;ll see that the police expect them. Nothing is lost
      yet, Señor Montgomery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the railway station, Natividad found he had just time to telephone his
      instructions to the Chorillos police. No motor coming from the direction
      of Callao was to be allowed to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were talking to the guard of the express when a Lima train steamed
      into the station, and they saw the Marquis, Uncle Francis and little
      Christobal appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Maria-Teresa?&rdquo; shouted the Marquis as he caught sight of Dick,
      and ran toward him. &ldquo;Why are you alone? Where is she? What has happened?
      Speak, boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Christobal, clinging to Dick&rsquo;s legs, reiterated his father&rsquo;s
      questions, while Uncle Francis&rsquo; long shanks took him wandering aimlessly
      round the little group. The guard blew his whistle, and Natividad pushed
      them all into a carriage just as the train started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she has been carried off by the Indians, but we know where she is.
      She is at Chorillos.&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s attempt to reduce the force of the blow to
      the Marquis partly succeeded. Then he explained what he knew while Don
      Christobal, raging in his corner, swore to kill with his own hands every
      Quichua in the country. Little Christobal, understanding only that his
      sister was lost, sobbed bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what had given the others the alarm? The Marquis explained that Aunt
      Agnes and Irene, going to church for the evening angelus, found that the
      Golden Sun bracelet had been stolen from the shrine of the Virgin of San
      Domingo. They had returned home in a panic, to find the Marquis nearly
      distracted with fear. Going to his club for the first time in a week, he
      had there found an anonymous letter warning him to watch over his daughter
      day and night throughout the Interaymi. This letter, a twin of the one
      received at Cajamarca, had been waiting some days. It particularly warned
      him not to allow his daughter to go to Callao on Saturday. It was then
      seven o&rsquo;clock, and going home to find that neither Maria-Teresa nor Dick
      were back, he had at once rushed to Callao. Little Christobal, refusing to
      listen to orders, had followed his father and Uncle Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick listened like one demented. He was silent, but his mind was in a
      turmoil. To think of such a thing! In a country where people used
      telephones and traveled by rail! It was too horrible, too incredible, yet
      horribly credible. There was no doubt in his mind now as to the reasons
      for the abduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natividad, closely questioned by the Marquis, finished by telling all he
      knew, and left them little hope. While loth to cause pain, he could not
      disguise certain facts. In a sense, too, he was triumphant. A
      conscientious official, he had once almost ruined his administrative
      career by certain reports on Quichua customs, dealing notably with the
      ritual murder of women and children. He had been laughed at, and called a
      lunatic&mdash;now the Red Ponchos were at work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence of despair greeted his words. Then, anxious to reassure them,
      the little old gentleman insisted that the Indians could not go far with
      their precious burden. All the defiles of the sierra were held by
      Veintemilla&rsquo;s troops. They would always give assistance to the police, and
      the Indians were bound to run into them as soon as they left the costa.
      The chief thing was not to lose the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the point where the railway line joined the highroad
      running parallel to the sea, and all eyes were fixed on the great white
      band stretching out there in the moonlight. At first, it was bordered by a
      few tumble-down cabins and bamboo cottages, but soon there was only the
      nakedness of a huge sandy plain before them. Dick, the Marquis and
      Natividad, grouped at the windows, searched the night, while Uncle Francis
      took little Christobal in his arms and strove to console him. But the boy
      insisted on being held up, that he also might see out, moaning the while:
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa, Maria-Teresa!... Why have they taken my big sister?...
      Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the same cry broke from them all: &ldquo;The motor!&rdquo; There it was,
      standing before the gates of a lonely hacienda. Natividad almost tore out
      the emergency cord, and the train, with a grinding of brakes, slowed down
      and then stopped. They tumbled to the line, Natividad shouting to the
      guard to go on, and send back police, troops and horses as soon as they
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick raced across the plain, while Natividad, panting in the rear, called
      out to him to be careful, and not to give the alarm. The young engineer
      drew a revolver as he reached the motor, ready to shoot down the first man
      he saw. But there was nobody there. The car was empty, and the courtyard
      of the hacienda showed deserted, peopled only by the blue shadows of
      moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gates were wide open, and he entered cautiously. Some of the buildings
      round the courtyard were in ruins; all were manifestly deserted. On his
      right, the bodega, or store-house; on his left, the proprietor&rsquo;s casa.
      Here again the doors were open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick returned to the motor, and was there rejoined by the Marquis and
      Natividad just as he lit one of the headlights. There was not a sound to
      be heard, and they followed the young man in silence. As they entered the
      first room of the house, a heavy, pungent perfume greeted their nostrils.
      Dick, leading the way, made a few cautious steps, and then fell back with
      a cry of horror. The furniture of the place was scattered in all
      directions, and there was blood everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa!&rdquo; The Marquis and Dick, both calling out at the same time,
      were as suddenly silent again. Both seemed to have heard a faint voice
      answering them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up there!&rdquo; shouted the young man, dashing toward a staircase leading
      to the first floor. All could now distinctly hear a low, prolonged moan.
      Dick, slipping on the stairs in his hurry, rose again with a white face.
      His hands were red with blood!

      III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he first two rooms
      were empty, but bore unmistakable signs of a desperate flight and
      struggle. Then a landing, a door and a dark cupboard, from which a loud
      cry for help now resounded throughout the deserted hacienda. Dick, signing
      to the Marquis to turn the light into the corner, bent down, and dragged a
      body from the cupboard. It was Libertad!
    </p>
    <p>
      Covered with knife-wounds, the negro boy was on the point of&rsquo; death,
      struggling for air. They took him into the next room, and threw open the
      windows, while Dick questioned him brutally. &ldquo;Where is your mistress?&rdquo; A
      feeble hand pointed toward the sierra, and Dick stood away from the dying
      man. That was all he wanted to know. The Red Ponchos were already on the
      road to the mountains with his fiancée.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dashed down into the road to find Uncle Francis with little Christobal.
      The boy, climbing into the motor had discovered his sister&rsquo;s cloak there,
      and was crying over it. He threw himself into Dick&rsquo;s arms, but was roughly
      pushed aside while the young engineer raged impotently.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could he do? Anything for a horse, a mule, something to carry on the
      pursuit! The irony of it! That motor there, which had served for the
      crime, was useless now on the narrow rocky mountain pathway which they
      must follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then little Christobal, listening with wide-open eyes, started. He had
      heard a noise at the far end of the court. Could there be horses in that
      deserted bodega. It sounded just like hoofs stamping on a plank flooring.
      Then the child heard a faint neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick had vanished, and Christobal, running toward the farm buildings,
      slipped through a half-open door. Yes, there was something there...
      llamas... three llamas,.. but thin, miserable creatures, worn out by the
      heavy loads of years, and incapable of carrying even a child. But llamas
      do not neigh. The boy slipped round the corner of the building, and
      stopped short in the shadow. Sitting motionless a few yards away was a
      horseman, watching the house. At his stirrup, attentively immobile as the
      horseman, was a llama&mdash;one of those light, fine-limbed, long-necked
      beasts which carry a man&rsquo;s belongings and follow him like a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Christobal caught sight of them, the horse shied. The rider reined it
      in, and swore, but his oath was cut short by a shot. A shadow had risen in
      the night, only a few feet away, and had fired; the rider rolled from his
      saddle, while the shadow, seizing the horse&rsquo;s bridle, swung itself into
      his place. Little Christobal ran toward it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your father I&rsquo;ve bagged one of them,&rdquo; shouted Dick, turning his
      mount and riding for the sierra.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child, without answering, ran after the llama, which in its turn was
      following the horse. His little fingers caught in its wool, he checked it
      with the words one uses to llamas, scrambled up and dashed after Dick.
      Uncle Francis, on the roadway, was passed by two black streaks, and left
      alone there, speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in the room on the first floor, Libertad was making his
      confession. Natavitad had realized, and had made the Marquis realize, the
      great value to them which this might have. Nor, to tell the truth, did he
      forget the value of the Marquis as a witness to this confession, which he
      regarded in the light of a valuable piece of fresh evidence in his case
      against the Indians generally. For this twofold reason, Natividad was
      merciless, and forced the negro to speak till his last breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      This confession, made in gasps and groans, built up by question and
      answer, and cut short by death, showed clearly that the abduction had been
      long planned, and that the daughter of the Marquis de la Torre had been
      chosen as the victim of the Interaymi at least two months before the
      festival. That was as clear as the wonderful tropical night without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months before, Libertad had first been sounded, and he had not long
      resisted the temptation of the money offered him. All he was asked to do
      was to drive the motor to a certain spot on a certain day, without looking
      to see what was happening behind him. For this, he was to receive two
      hundred silver soles, of which fifty were paid to him in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who did you make the bargain with?&rdquo; demanded Natividad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a clerk from the Franco-Belgian bank who sometimes came to see the
      señorita. His name was Oviedo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal started. Oviedo Huayna Runtu, the intruder of the Cajamarca
      trip! If he had planned to kidnap Maria-Teresa at Callao, that voyage must
      have been particularly disagreeable to him. That would explain his close
      watch over them, and perhaps also the hint to the police at Cajamarca,
      which resulted in their hasty return to Lima.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you first know the date chosen?&rdquo; questioned Natividad, holding
      up the negro, who was choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning. Oviedo came to see me. He told me that a man would say to
      me, &lsquo;Dios anki tiourata&rsquo; (&lsquo;good-day,&rsquo; in Aimara), and that I was to obey
      that man. I was to take the wheel, not turn my head, and drive where I was
      told to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Libertad&rsquo;s story, told in jerky sentences, showed that he did not really
      know until the evening what had been plotted. Though he did not move or
      look, the sound of the struggle at the open window told him what was
      happening. It was then too late to draw back, and, when the order came, he
      drove the car to the calle San Lorenzo, where they stopped for a minute
      before a low door. Huascar came out, exchanged a few words with the
      occupants of the machine, and ordered him to take the Chorillos road, and
      not to stop until he had reached Ondegarda&rsquo;s hacienda. There was not a
      sound behind him throughout the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hacienda, when his passengers got out, he had instinctively glanced
      sideways, and had seen the señorita, unconscious, being lifted out by
      three dwarfs with horribly-shaped heads. They took her into the casa,
      while he, more dead than alive, waited where he was, anxious only to be
      paid and to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they were overtaken by a troop of mounted Indians, all wearing red
      ponchos, and led by Oviedo. Huascar was also with them, and ordered
      Libertad to come into the house. To his surprise, he found there half a
      dozen women, veiled in black, and guarding the door to another room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mammaconas,&rdquo; gasped Natividad. &ldquo;We can have no doubts now.... Speak,
      Libertad.... Speak, and God may forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the mammaconas,&rdquo; said the negro lad, feverishly.... &ldquo;But I did not
      know.... God will forgive me.... The señorita, too, will forgive me....
      You must save her.... She was so good to me.... And I betrayed her...
      betrayed her for two hundred silver soles.... They did not know I
      understood Aimara... they said that Atahualpa would have a beautiful
      bride.... And they fell on their faces before her when she passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw her, then?&rdquo; demanded the Marquis, bending low over the prostrate
      figure at his feet to catch the faint words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw her.... She was so good.... And I sold her for two hundred
      silver soles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us how it happened,&rdquo; interrupted Natividad. &ldquo;Was she no longer
      unconscious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came out of the room, held up by women in black veils... the three
      dwarfs were dancing around her.... She seemed to be in a dream... they
      have terrible poisons and perfumes.... My sweet señorita... wrapped in a
      gold veil... her face was hidden... only her eyes, staring sightlessly
      before her.... The mammaconas were all round her... and the dwarfs were
      dancing. I saw it all, because they had left me alone, and I looked out of
      the window... they put her on a mule... in front of one of the
      mammaconas... and the others followed.... Yes, señor, it is true... all
      these stories you hear in the ranchos.... Quite true... the dwarfs
      followed, señor.... Oviedo was there... they had prepared everything in
      this hacienda.... I believe they murdered the owner and all his people....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw it all.... I did not care then that I had not been paid.... I
      watched.... And the Red Ponchos carried off my mistress... they are taking
      her to the Temple of the Sun.... It is the Interaymi.... But you will find
      them first... You must.... And God will forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Libertad closed his eyes and fell back, but seemed to recover his forces
      with the last flicker of life, and opened them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; asked Natividad. &ldquo;Was it in trying to save your
      mistress?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Libertad smiled bitterly, and tried to cross himself, but his arm fell
      nerveless by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huascar,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He came into the room, and when I asked him to pay
      me, pointed to the two hundred silver soles... they were on the table
      there.... Not one over.... It was not much for betraying my mistress.... I
      did not know that was what they wanted.... When I told him so, he asked me
      what I would have done if I had known.... I answered I would have asked
      double the amount....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he drew a knife and came at me.... I ran, but he followed.... He
      stabbed me once, and I escaped, but he followed.... I ran upstairs.... He
      stabbed me again and again.... When I fell, he thought I was dead... and I
      am... I am... dying... oh!... Have mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Libertad&rsquo;s last moment had come. The Marquis and Natividad, bending over
      him, were startled by the shot outside, and rushed downstairs. They found
      Uncle Francis by the motor, staring down the road. When they asked him
      where Dick and little Christobal were, he gazed back as if not
      understanding, and vaguely answered that he was looking for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal and Natividad, turning to look in the direction the old
      scientist was staring, suddenly saw two shadows dash across a moonlit
      stretch of road and vanish in the darkness of a ravine leading into the
      mountains, and spanned above by the railway bridge. Dick on his horse,
      little Christobal on his llama, did not even check for an instant at their
      hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the hoof-beats died out in the depths of the ravine than the
      sound of galloping horses came from the right, on the Chorillos road. A
      moment later, a knot of riders appeared.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>orses!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Natividad. &ldquo;Then we have them. They are probably making for the Cuzco, or
      some place round Titicaca, But they are bound to pass through
      Veintemilla&rsquo;s lines, and we shall catch them at Canete or Pisco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Natividad had surmised, the riders were cavalrymen sent out from
      Chorillos at his order. They ran toward them, Uncle Francis questioning
      the Marquis, who did not answer. Indeed, Don Christobal, doubly anxious
      now that his son had left his side, could not contain himself. Hardly had
      the troopers dismounted than he swung himself into the nearest saddle, and
      rode off after Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheer madness,&rdquo; growled Natividad. &ldquo;If they ever overhaul the Indians,
      they are lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to do now?&rdquo; demanded Uncle Francis. Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s fate
      moved him deeply, particularly from a literary point of view, but under
      the circumstances he asked no better than to keep a little in the
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can only follow at a distance,&rdquo; replied Natividad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent... excellent... find out where they are making for, and all
      that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are still laws, a police force and troops in Peru, señor. We are
      not afraid of the Indians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With which he turned to the four soldiers who had joined them, and who
      represented what remained of the military force of the costa. Uncle
      Francis, already delighted with Natividad&rsquo;s plan of following at a
      distance, approved of it even more warmly when he found that this little
      escort was to accompany them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three policemen mounted on mules, coming from the direction of Callao, now
      appeared on the road. Natividad at once requisitioned the mules for his
      expedition. Before starting, however, he went back into the casa to write
      a hurried letter to President Veintemilla, explaining what had happened.
      He did so with a certain malice, remembering that ten years ago this same
      president had been Chief of Police, and had threatened to suspend him for
      his &ldquo;mad reports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the policemen, entrusted with the letter, started back toward
      Callao at once. The two others were ordered to take charge at the hacienda
      and begin a preliminary enquiry. Then Natividad and Uncle Francis mounted
      two of the commandeered mules, the third being taken by the soldier whose
      horse had been carried off by Don Christobal. When the soldiers saw that
      they were heading for the sierra instead of Chorillos, there was a
      grumble, but Natividad silenced them. &ldquo;Forward,&rdquo; he ordered, and they, in
      their turn, entered the ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can, at all events, travel as fast as the mammaconas,&rdquo; said the Chief
      of Police to Uncle Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mammaconas? Were they here then?&rdquo; The scientist, intensely
      interested, urged his mount alongside Natividad&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes señor... the mammaconas... and three head priests of the temple...
      only they may touch the Virgin of the Sun.... señor, for the past fifteen
      years I have known all this, but they called me a lunatic. Why should we
      suppose that the Indians have changed? Do they not eat, drink, and get
      married just as they did five centuries ago? If their outward customs have
      not changed, why should their secret rites have done so? Why, señor,
      why?... But nobody will believe me. It all began when I was a young man. I
      had to investigate a mysterious crime, the only possible explanation for
      which was a religious one. You must not forget that you are dealing with
      Incas to this day.... And I got my knuckles rapped.... Five years later,
      when the Orellana girl disappeared, they treated me in the same way. So I
      let them give what explanation they liked, and worked on my own. I speak
      Quichua like a native now, señor. I also learned Aimara, which is their
      sacred language in the Cuzco and round Titicaca.... That&rsquo;s where they are
      making for now; some hidden temple, where their priests have been working
      since the days of the conquest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Francis looked at his companion suspiciously. Were they all engaged
      in a huge practical joke at his expense? This Chief of Police was
      singularly calm under the circumstances; off-handed, almost gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are sure to catch them, are we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a surety, señor. Dios mio, be content! We will catch them.... How can
      they possibly escape? We are on their heels; if they stick to the
      mountains, they run into our troops; if they go down into the costa, every
      corregidor (mayor) is at my orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, and he went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not put on that cloak at your saddle-bow, señor? The nights are
      chilly, and we are nearing the cordilleras.... The only road, you see.
      They must have passed here. At dawn, we shall be able to see their trail
      distinctly.... If only those crazy people who dashed on ahead do not make
      fools of themselves.... A plucky youngster, little Christobal.... We shall
      soon overhaul them.... One does not climb these mountains as a bull jumps
      over the barrier at the ring....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natividad&rsquo;s garrulous flow of words was interrupted by a chuckle from
      Uncle Francis. Not a little astonished, he asked him what he meant, but
      Mr. Montgomery contented himself with replying:&mdash;&ldquo;I understand, I
      understand.&rdquo; Natividad, who did not understand, eyed him doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before day-break they reached the first masses of the true Andes.
      Their mounts did not appear over-tired, and after a two-hours&rsquo; halt at a
      wayside guebrada, where beasts and men obtained food, they continued the
      journey. Over them towered the giant mountain chain, blazing in the molten
      light of dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-breeds at the guebrada could not, or would not, give them any
      information as to those they followed. That the Indian cavalcade had not
      stopped there, however, was certain, or larder and loft would have been
      empty. Natividad, convinced he would get nothing else out of the men,
      forced them, in the name of &ldquo;the supreme government,&rdquo; to exchange two
      strong mules for two of the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after they had started again, they came on unmistakable traces of
      a strong party of horse. Thistles, and the great yellow flower of the
      amancaes, trampled flat, showed where hoofs had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are close on them now, señor,&rdquo; said Natividad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Francis, coughing knowingly, assented in such a detached manner that
      Natividad began to have serious doubts as to the mental welfare of that
      illustrious scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long, though, he was worrying a great deal more about something
      else. So far, there had not been a sign anywhere of the Indians&rsquo; first
      pursuers. Uncle Francis, on the other hand, was thoroughly happy, and
      seemed to be enjoying the scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they climbed steadily upwards, the road was becoming more and more
      dangerous, twisting and turning round the mountain-side. Peaks, sky, and
      precipices; in the blue of the distance, a few mountain goats, all four
      feet joined together, balancing on some rocky point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold was now intense, and the soldiers grumbled openly. When Natividad
      reminded them that they were serving &ldquo;the supreme government,&rdquo; they let it
      be inferred that they did not give a tinker&rsquo;s damn for the supremo
      gobesnie, but nevertheless followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of those men of yours?&rdquo; asked Uncle Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as of myself,&rdquo; replied Natividad, determined to be optimistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they? Indians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quichuas, of course.... Where else would we get soldiers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not seem to me to be enthusiastic militarists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A grave error, señor. They are delighted to be soldiers. What else could
      they be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are volunteers, then?&rdquo; questioned the scientist. And to Natividad&rsquo;s
      stupefaction, he produced his note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not volunteers, illustrious señor.... We send troops into the Indian
      villages, and arrest every able-bodied man who has not bolted. Then we
      enroll them as volunteers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming! And you are not afraid that they may turn on you when you have
      armed them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. After the first few days they decide they are so much
      better off under the colors that they would not go back to their families
      for anything.... You should see them join in the recruiting afterwards!...
      They make very good soldiers.... These men are only annoyed at being taken
      into the mountains; they would die for Veintemilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; concluded Uncle Francis philosophically. And he
      added, to Natividad&rsquo;s growing amazement:&mdash;&ldquo;But why insist on their
      coming with us? We can find those other Indians just as well without their
      aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natividad jumped. What kind of a man was this? Then his attention was
      suddenly drawn to the road again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, over there! They camped there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point, the mountain path widened to a kind of little plateau, on
      which were unmistakable traces of a recently-pitched camp. The ashes of
      the fire had not yet been swept away by the wind, and remains of food
      littered one corner. Natividad, convinced that he had found the first
      resting-place of the escort of the Virgin of the Sun, urged on his party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we should have seen nothing yet of the
      Marquis, little Christobal, or your nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why worry? We&rsquo;ll find them all, sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sooner or later&mdash;some day.... Hello, what&rsquo;s the matter? This beast
      of mine won&rsquo;t move. Gee up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calm and collected, quite different from the frightened Mr. Montgomery of
      the flight from Cajamarca, he urged on his mount, but the mule refused to
      answer to his heel. Then Natividad, pressing forward to see what was the
      matter, saw the body of a llama stretched across the narrow path.
      Dismounting, he lifted its head, examined the nostrils, and then pushed
      the body over the edge of the ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Christobal&rsquo;s llama,&rdquo; he pronounced. &ldquo;The animal has been ridden to
      death.... Poor child! I wonder where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Francis, busy with his note-book, refused to get excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my nephew, probably. Even if Dick had left him behind, his father
      must have come upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is possible, of course,&rdquo; said Natividad, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this llama-riding common over here?&rdquo; questioned the scientist, intent
      on acquiring knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Children sometimes amuse themselves with it if the llama is willing.
      Rich people give them to their sons occasionally. Christobal probably had
      his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would never have believed a llama capable of going so far, and so
      fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No pack-llama could. But that was a good one, trained to carry light
      weights and travel fast. Probably used to being ridden by children.... I
      wonder where they found it... Your nephew&rsquo;s horse, too... in the hacienda
      stables, I suppose.... A tragedy might have been avoided had they not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little party had ridden on, and now, taking a sharp corner, came
      suddenly upon Dick and the Marquis, the former on foot, and the latter
      mounted. Little Christobal was not there.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ick was pale, but
      the Marquis was livid. So they appeared to Natividad; as to Uncle Francis,
      he had not his glasses on, and noticed nothing disquieting in their
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those scoundrels have both my children now,&rdquo; groaned Don Christobal in
      answer to Natividad&rsquo;s eager questions, and told what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Badly mounted for mountain roads, the Marquis had found great difficulty
      in following. Several times he had been on the point of abandoning his
      horse, but, thinking it might be valuable later on, had kept to it. Once
      or twice he had been obliged to dismount and drag the unwilling beast
      behind him. At dawn, he reached the Indians&rsquo; camp, which he searched in
      vain for some personal sign of his daughter. She was evidently too well
      guarded. Finally he found the llama&rsquo;s body, but being convinced that Dick
      was with little Christobal, had not worried overmuch. Then, a little
      further on, he found Dick, but alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, powerless to interfere, had seen little Christobal carried off by
      the same Indians who already held Maria-Teresa. When they started on their
      wild ride, and as soon as the road became steeper, the llama had rapidly
      outpaced Dick&rsquo;s horse. Little Christobal, riding it hard, would not stop,
      and soon vanished ahead. Two hours later, Dick had lost his horse in a
      ravine, throwing himself from the saddle only just in time, and narrowly
      saving his own life by clinging to a projecting rock. He continued his
      pursuit on foot, and finally came in sight of the boy, just as the llama,
      exhausted, burst a blood-vessel and fell. He had called to little
      Christobal, but the boy, unheeding, had run on, crying, &ldquo;Maria-Teresa!
      Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were right on the Indians then, and Dick could see them far above him
      on the zig-zagging mountain-path. They had checked their horses, waiting
      for the boy to catch up to them. Then one of the Red Ponchos bent down,
      lifted him up to his saddle-bow, and hurried on with his new captive. Dick
      was too far away to open fire, and the Indians had at once spurred on,
      soon leaving him far behind. The Marquis had come up a short time after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not despair, Don Christobal,&rdquo; urged Natividad. &ldquo;Your news is not
      all bad. They are only just ahead, and cannot escape us. They must pass
      through Huancavelica, and there we have troops to help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natividad ordered one of the soldiers to dismount and give his mule to
      Dick. The man was indignant, and continued protesting in a weird jargon as
      he trotted afoot behind the cavalcade. In this manner they reached a point
      where the road forked, one branch going on up into the hills, the other
      stretching down toward the coast. They had all turned up the former when
      the dismounted soldier turned&mdash;he would go no further, but would
      descend to the coast; and once there he would report to the powers the
      manner in which he had been treated by a mere civilian. Natividad wished
      him an ironical good-by, and he started, but only to reappear a moment
      later, waving a soft felt hat in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That belongs to Christobal!&rdquo; exclaimed the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned their mounts, grateful for the chance-found sign which had
      saved them from a grievous mistake. Natividad alone hesitated, wondering
      whether this was not an Indian ruse. They advanced slowly therefore, until
      the mud and sand on the banks of a torrent just below showed beyond doubt
      that a large number of mounted men had passed that way and restored
      Natividad&rsquo;s serene belief in the ultimate success of their search.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they&rsquo;re doubling back to the costa. They must have been warned that
      the passes were guarded... all they have gained by the detour is avoiding
      Chorillos.... Perhaps they are making for Canete.... Well, they must stop
      somewhere, and then we have them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After an hour&rsquo;s rest, they hurried on again at top speed, one of the
      soldiers giving his dismounted comrade a lift behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you, then, ever think that we might not catch them?&rdquo; asked Uncle
      Francis of Natividad, with an enigmatical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, señor?... Between you and me, it is about time we did catch
      them.... I for one shall not feel happy if señorita de la Torre and the
      boy are still in their hands on the last day of the Interaymi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that the boy is in danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak lower, señor, speak lower.... Nothing is too young, too beautiful
      or too innocent for the Sun. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More or less. More or less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You people do not know what horrors they are capable of.... They still
      have their priests.... You might blink at facts if it were only the
      ordinary Red Ponchos, but there are also those three monsters.... You
      always find them together in the old burial-grounds.... When one dies, the
      other two are put to death.... Or when a king died, they sacrificed
      themselves on his tomb.... They still exist, those monsters, those
      high-priests of the sacred slaughters.... They exist, señor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, señor, are a savant, and know about the Temple of Death. But do you
      know how many dead were found buried with the mummy of Huayna Capac? Four
      thousand, señor! Four thousand human lives sacrificed to honor the dead&mdash;some
      by suicide, others strangled, knifed or suffocated.... And the House of
      the Serpent.... But I prefer not to tell you what happened there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me some other day.... You make an admirable guide. When we return, I
      will tell the supremo gobierno how grateful I am to them for having made
      the most erudite of police officers my cicerone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, señor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natividad, completely taken aback, could only stare at his interlocutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing! I am only joking!&rdquo; Scandalized at such levity,
      Natividad turned away with an indignant snort, while Uncle Francis
      chuckled. That worthy gentleman had now quite made up his mind that there
      was a plot afoot against him, and sternly refused to be &ldquo;taken in.&rdquo; The
      joke was rather tiring physically, but he would not cry for mercy. As to
      all these hair-raising stories, he would take them for what they were
      worth. Let them play their pranks till they tired of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he thought of it, the more he became convinced of the truth of
      his deductions. His antiquarian&rsquo;s eye rested lovingly on the traces of
      that long-dead Inca civilization which they met. Here, aqueducts that
      would have made the Romans wonder; there, remains of the great road which
      ran from end to end of South America. They were all dead, those Incas. Yet
      these people wished to make him believe that those vanished warriors and
      priests had carried off a boy and girl of to-day to offer them as a
      sacrifice to equally-forgotten gods!
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now left the arid ranges and dusty wind behind them, and reached
      a little village nestling in green fields at the foot of the mountain. A
      babbling stream, tumbling down from the Cordilleras, had transformed this
      corner into an oasis of verdure, in which Uncle Francis would willingly
      have passed a few hours. But now that they were in flat country again,
      Dick, the Marquis and Natividad increased the pace feverishly. Uncle
      Francis, still determined not to show that he had fathomed their plot, was
      careful not to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice, they stopped to ask questions, but it was difficult to
      obtain information. Hamlets were rare, and the Interaymi festivals had
      drawn away nearly the whole population. The few Indians they met received
      their questions with evident suspicion, and even hostility. Nor would
      money loosen their tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, there were half-breeds more ready to talk, and they learned
      that Huascar and his companions were riding hard. Nobody had seen Red
      Ponchos; presumably the priests had concealed the ceremonial raiment
      imposed by their ritual for the reception of the Bride of the Sun. They
      were traveling so fast that nobody had had time to notice whether they had
      a captive boy or young woman with them. At the questions on this score all
      their informants began to grow uneasy, and turned away with evasive
      sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huascar and his men had about two hours&rsquo; start, but it soon became evident
      that they were gaining ground steadily. Natividad could not fathom the
      meaning of the Indians sudden turn toward the sea, this riding into a town
      where, normally, everything must be against them if the alarm was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached Canete at nightfall, Dick still leading. There was a big fête
      on, with torchlight processions and the deafening noise of fireworks set
      off by delirious roisterers. Half the native population was under the
      influence of drink, and Natividad, trained to understand the populace, at
      once saw that the town was in a state of dangerous effervescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the towns in Peru, Canete is perhaps the one which shows most
      markedly that strange admixture of the new and old. Factory chimneys tower
      to the sky side by side with Inca aqueducts which to this day bring the
      water of the Rio Canete to the surrounding plantations. Just above the
      town are still the remains of the huge native fortress demolished some two
      hundred years ago by the then viceroy of Mañdelova when he needed
      materials for the defenses of Callao.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natividad&rsquo;s first visit was to the corregidor, who told him that the town
      was celebrating Garcia&rsquo;s victories. It was now certain that the rebels had
      captured Cuzco, and routed the Federal forces. Natividad then told him of
      the plight of the Marquis de la Torre&rsquo;s children. The Mayor was skeptical,
      and showed it. Indians committing such a crime, he said, would never have
      dared pass through a town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They could not stop in the Sierra,&rdquo; said Natividad, &ldquo;and had to make for
      somewhere. Perhaps they intend taking boat, and reaching Arequipa by sea.
      They could get up into the Cuzco that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is more than possible,&rdquo; replied the corregidor, anxious to rid
      himself of the troublesome visitor. &ldquo;A troop of strange Indians has, in
      fact, passed through the town. They bought provisions, and then hurried on
      to Pisco. They might have a boat ready there.... Personally, I can do
      nothing for you. I haven&rsquo;t a single soldier or policeman to dispose of.
      They have all gone to fight Garcia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, an extraordinary procession passed under the corregidor&rsquo;s
      windows. A dancing, singing procession, at the head of which Natividad
      recognized his four troopers. He opened the window and shouted menaces,
      but they passed unheeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sad mood Natividad rejoined his companions. Without any explanation,
      he told them they must follow to Pisco, and they started again. Natividad,
      in a brown study meanwhile, would answer no questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal, hearing that the Indians were making for Pisco, grew
      hopeful. He was known in the town, having a branch business there, with
      big guano dépôts, stores in the harbor, and a considerable coolie station
      on the Chincha Islands, which are just off the town. There he could speak
      with authority, and make the corregidor listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached Pisco dog-tired, on mounts that could hardly stand. Uncle
      Francis alone displayed a calm and unconcern which would have convinced
      the others he was mad, had they had time to notice him. The news of
      Garcia&rsquo;s victory had just reached Pisco, and the mob was even more
      delirious than that of Canete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis, taking the leadership, led the way to his dépôt and stores,
      only to find them completely deserted. There was not a single employee
      there to answer his questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the corregidor&rsquo;s, then,&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four travelers had entered the main and only street of the town, and
      were riding toward the sandy central square when a thundering <i>feu de
      joie</i> made them pull up. The Indians were burning the sacred maize-leaf
      in honor of Garcia, to the grave danger of the little blue-and-white
      houses around. The inhabitants of these, well-to-do half-breeds, had
      locked themselves in, or taken to flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The madness of alcohol and the madness of fire crackers had taken firm
      hold of all that was visible of the population. The mob had pillaged a
      pisco distillery, and was enjoying itself thoroughly with that virulent
      spirit, which is made from a kind of Malaga grape, and takes its name from
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natividad, casting round for a guide, found a half-breed sadly huddled
      under a doorway. He doubtless was one of those who had something to lose
      by the rioting; a house to be burned, or a cellar to be plundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; he said, when asked where the corregidor could be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led them along a plank pavement which was just beginning to burn, until
      they reached the corner of the arena, opposite the church. Four skinny
      palms adorned the center of the square, and at the foot of one of these a
      mob was dancing round a fire. Above, something was hanging from a branch.
      The half-breed pointed to that thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the corregidor,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natividad, Dick and the Marquis stopped short, mute with horror. The
      half-breed whispered a few rapid words to Natividad, who turned to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on! Come on!&rdquo; he almost screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this hurry?&rdquo; demanded Uncle Francis, phlegmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Why?... Because they are going to eat him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not really?&rdquo; drawled the scientist with mediocre interest. &ldquo;Right away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Natividad did not notice his tone. He was really running away, for he
      had not forgotten a scene in Lima, when the Guttierg brothers were torn
      from the presidency they had usurped by the same mob which had placed them
      there. Massacred, then hanged over the cathedral gates, they were finally
      roasted and devoured by the populace.
    </p>
    <p>
      So fast did Natividad flee, that Dick and the Marquis could hardly keep up
      with him. Uncle Francis, bringing up the rear, was muttering to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn nonsense, sir, damn nonsense. They&rsquo;re not going to frighten me.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>requipa was <i>en
      fête</i>; the entire population of the city and its campina (suburbs) was
      packed in the main square and the adjacent streets to witness the
      triumphal return of the victor of the Cuzco&mdash;brave General Garcia,
      who had already been christened &ldquo;the good Dictator,&rdquo; and who had promised
      his partizans that within a fortnight he would sweep out of the country
      President Veintemilla, the two Chambers, and the whole parliamentary
      system which, he declared, had ruined Peru.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was language the Arequipinos loved and understood. Politics had
      always flourished in that part of the country, and all revolutions began
      there. And the turbulent inhabitants of Arequipa felt that it was a
      terribly long time since they had had a &ldquo;savior&rdquo; to cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they had one; a particularly picturesque one, who was to appear on
      horseback. So they had all donned their Sunday clothes, and the women had
      flowers in their hair and more flowers in their arms to scatter before the
      hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian population, having sold its hens and vegetables in the
      market-place, joined the throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      The square, for the occasion, seemed to have straightened out its
      tumble-down arcades, badly shaken by the last earthquake. The illusion was
      aided by brilliant-hued carpets, flags, banners and festoons which blazed
      in all directions and gave new life to the dilapidated walls. The cracked
      old towers of the church, the carved wooden balconies, flower-adorned
      galleries, and decorated windows were black with people. Above the city
      rose the Misti, one of the world&rsquo;s highest volcanoes, wearing a fresh cap,
      glistening with the snows of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bells chimed and cannons roared out. Then came silence, broken again by the
      sound of bugles and the roar of a thousand voices. The procession of the
      troops had begun. Contrary to European custom, it commenced with all the
      impedimenta of the camp. It was like a rout:&mdash;Indians leading mules
      loaded down with baggage, provisions, and kitchen utensils; then a
      regiment of women bent under the weight of knapsacks, babies, and sacks of
      food.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd cheered everything wildly, from the llamas loaded with captured
      Federal arms to the women, the rabonas, as they are called out there.
      These rabonas are a precious institution from the point of view of the
      Peruvian soldier; each man has his own, and she carries his baggage, buys
      all his food, and prepares his meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the troops, Garcia, leading. Mounted on a splendid horse,
      wearing a brilliant uniform, he appeared like a star of the first
      magnitude in the constellation of his staff. A tall man, he showed head
      and shoulders above the generals and colonels prancing around him. His
      tri-color plumes waved splendidly in the wind, and the deafening rant of
      bugles accompanied him. Handsome, radiant, happy was he, nonchalantly
      curling his black mustache and smiling on all with brilliant white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia smiled to the ladies as he passed under their balconies, and the
      ladies, showering down rose-leaves over horse and rider, called him by his
      Christian name, Pedro. In this triumphal fashion, he slowly rode round the
      square twice, and then came to a halt in the middle of it, between two
      guns, his staff behind him and, before him, two Indians bearing a
      standard, a quaint patch-work quilt of a flag, which was the token of
      submission of all the tribes to the new government. These men wore hats
      covered with variegated plumes, and had over their shoulders surplice-like
      tunics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five hundred infantrymen and two hundred horse had formed round the
      square. Young girls, clad in floating tunics and wearing Garcia&rsquo;s colors,
      advanced toward the general, their hands heavy with floral crowns. One of
      them made a little speech, while Garcia continued curling his mustache and
      showing his teeth. The speech over, he gallantly bent down and took all
      the crowns, passing them over his arm. Then he lifted a hand to command
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live Liberty!&rdquo; he shouted. A hurricane of cheers arose. Again he
      lifted up the crown-charged arm, and again there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told them the program of the new Government meant &ldquo;Liberty for all,
      except for evil-doers! With such a program, is there any need for
      parliaments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No! No!&rdquo; roared the crowd deliriously. &ldquo;Long live Garcia! Death to,
      Veintemilla! Muera! Muera! Muera el larron de salitre! (Death to the
      saltpetre thief! ),&rdquo; for Veintemilla was popularly supposed to have
      largely profited by some recent concessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia was an orator, and, wishing to show it once again, told in a few
      words the history of the campaign that had ended in the rout of the
      &ldquo;saltpetre thieves&rdquo; on the Cuzco plains. To be seen and heard by all, he
      stood erect in his stirrups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then an incredible thing happened. The powers above actually dared spoil
      this splendid <i>fête</i>&mdash;it began to rain! There was a general rush
      for shelter in the crowd. Even the infantrymen lining the square broke
      their ranks, while the cavalrymen dismounted, took off their saddles and
      loaded them on their heads in guise of umbrellas. As to those soldierly
      ladies, the rabonas, they calmly threw their bell-shaped petticoats over
      their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia alone did not move. Furious at this spoiling of his triumph, he
      threatened his officers with immediate death if they dared leave his side.
      He did not even fall back into his saddle, but stood erect there, his
      crown-charged arm menacing the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Chief of Staff approached the Dictator, saluted thrice, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellency, it is not the fault of the sky. The sky would not have dared!
      The roar of your guns compelled the clouds, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; replied Garcia. &ldquo;And since the guns did the harm, let
      them repair it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With which, a battery was rolled out into the square, and opened fire on
      the clouds. They thundered on until the short tropical storm had passed.
      Then Garcia, triumphant, shouted: &ldquo;I have had the last word with the
      heavens!&rdquo; The review was over.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>atching the
      proceedings from a window at the &ldquo;Jockey Club Hotel&rdquo; were the Marquis de
      la Torre and Natividad, both wild with impatience, for their only hope now
      lay in Garcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Pisco, they had ended by discovering that the Bride of the Sun&rsquo;s escort
      had embarked in the very steam-tug used to tow the Marquis&rsquo; own barges
      from the Chincha Islands to Callao. This once again proved that the scheme
      had been well thought out and prepared long in advance, the Indians about
      Maria-Teresa being in the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Securing a boat in their turn, the pursuers followed to Mollendo. There
      they took the train, and reached Arequipa only a few hours after the Red
      Ponchos&mdash;Uncle Francis still supernaturally calm, and Natividad
      beginning to despair of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chance favored them when they landed in this city of mad people, who would
      not even trouble to answer questions. Dick recognized Huascar strolling
      through the streets, and tracked him to the house where Maria-Teresa and
      her brother were kept prisoners. This was a low adobe building on the edge
      of the suburbs, and quite close to the Rio de Chili. It was openly guarded
      by a dozen armed Indians in red ponchos. Dick and the Marquis soon found,
      however, that they could not even get as near as that line of guards.
      Fifty yards away from the house, Civil Guards stopped them, and ordered
      them back. Garcia&rsquo;s own troops were guarding the Virgin of the Sun!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Garcia cannot know,&rdquo; said the Marquis. &ldquo;I know him, and though
      he has faults, he is not a savage. He once wanted to marry Maria-Teresa.
      Let us go and find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dick refused to lose sight of the adobe house. Had they listened to
      him, they would have forced their way to it at once. It was only after
      long arguing that Natividad convinced him such a step would be absurd.
      Lives are cheap during revolutions, and two or three corpses more or less
      in the Rio de Chili would not make it overflow its banks. Nor would they
      contribute greatly to the freeing of Maria-Teresa and little Christobal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He promised to be reasonable, but would not go with them when they
      returned to the inn for a meal; instead, he took up his post in a boat on
      the river, and thence watched his fiancée&rsquo;s prison and the armed men
      walking up and down before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis and Natividad therefore, witnessed Garcia&rsquo;s triumph alone.
      Uncle Francis had been lost, or rather, had been left alone in the middle
      of the street, staring up at the Misti. He was now doubtless in the crowd
      somewhere, taking notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia in all his glory was a sight which did not please the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought he was that kind of man,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;though I always
      suspected he had negro blood in his veins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drunk with success,&rdquo; replied Natividad drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the review, they followed the Dictator and his staff only to find
      their way barred by troops at the road leading down to the headquarters.
      Here the Marquis ordered the men out of the way with such insolence, and
      spoke with such assurance of &ldquo;his friend Garcia,&rdquo; that he was allowed to
      pass, Natividad clinging to his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subaltern in command at the guard-room took the Marquis&rsquo; card, and a
      moment later they were ushered upstairs. There were soldiers everywhere,
      some of them fast asleep on the staircase, their guns between their knees,
      so that the visitors had to pick their way upstairs over prostrate bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, their guide pushed open a door and ushered them into a bedroom,
      where Garcia was presiding over a meeting of the Cabinet he had appointed
      the previous day. Some of these high functionaries were seated on the
      Dictator&rsquo;s bed, others on the table, and one on a bundle of soiled linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were received more than courteously. Garcia, who was in his
      shirt-sleeves, and shaving, ran toward the Marquis with both hands
      outstretched, scattering white flakes from his shaving-brush as he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, señor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Antique simplicity! Antique simplicity!...
      I receive you as I would a friend... for I trust you come as a friend, as
      a friend of the new Government. Let me introduce you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began with the Minister of War, who was astride the bolster, and
      finished up with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, a hideous
      half-breed chewing cocoa-nut leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fuss, you see,&rdquo; babbled on Garcia. &ldquo;Antique simplicity. Cato, and all
      that sort of thing.... Nothing like antiquity, sir, to make men.... The
      good padres taught us that, and I took the lesson to heart.&rdquo; He laughed.
      &ldquo;All that show is for outside... the crowds like it. You must amuse the
      crowd!... Did you see my review? Splendid, wasn&rsquo;t it?... Magnificent
      soldiers.... And the rain., Did you see what I did? Effective, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daring all this verbiage, Garcia was thinking hard, and watching the
      new-comers&rsquo; faces. He was far from being a fool. Were they, or were they
      not, ambassadors from Veintemilla? Would he accept a compromise, if they
      came to offer it? In a moment his mind was made up; he would refuse, and
      risk everything on the result of this rising, his large fortune and his
      life included.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the Marquis was able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to ask the assistance of the master of Peru.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words the Dictator, who was washing the soap from his face,
      looked up in surprise over a towel. He knew that the Marquis was a
      personal friend of Veintemilla. Natividad looked away uneasily, for he was
      compromising himself horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The master of Peru,&rdquo; repeated the Marquis, &ldquo;whose motto is &lsquo;Liberty for
      all.&rsquo; I want him to restore to me my two children, who have been stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stolen! What do you mean, señor? Those who have done this thing shall be
      punished. I swear it by my ancestor, Pedro de la Vega, who gave his life
      for the True Faith, and was killed by the infidels in the year of grace
      1537 at the Battle of Xauxa, in which he received seventeen wounds while
      fighting at the side of the illustrious Christobal de la Torre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis had always said that Garcia was in no way descended from Pedro
      de la Vega, and Garcia knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those same infidels have now carried off my daughter, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beautiful señorita! But what do you mean by infidels? What infidels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been kidnaped from Callao by the Quichuas... as a sacrifice to
      their gods during the Interaymi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacrifice!... Interaymi... but that cannot be, señor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of what I say, Excellency, and she has certainly been carried
      off. Let me introduce señor Perez, the inspector superior of the police of
      Callao. Like myself, he is devoted to your cause. He will tell you the
      same thing. Speak, Natividad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horrified at the form of the Marquis&rsquo; introduction, Natividad stammered a
      corroboration. If Garcia did not win now, all that was left for him to do
      was to cross the Bolivian frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change in Garcia&rsquo;s manner was immediate. He did not want trouble with
      the Quichuas, his partisans and allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can do nothing for you, señor. All this happened in Callao.
      Veintemilla is still master there, and you must go to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are now in this very city, imprisoned in a house which is guarded by
      your own troops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not possible. I should have known it. But if by some
      extraordinary fact this is so, you have not done wrong in coming to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew I would not appeal to you in vain. As long as I live, I shall not
      forget this service. I have friends in Lima, señor! And this gentleman
      also,&rdquo; he pointed to Natividad. &ldquo;The police of Callao is yours.... Only
      accompany us to the gates of the city, and set my children free, and my
      life and my fortune are yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I cannot come myself, for I am expecting the British Consul.
      But I will send my Minister for War with you. You will find him just as
      useful.&rdquo; Garcia turned and whistled for the dignitary in question, who
      seemed in no hurry to move. &ldquo;Go and see what is happening,&rdquo; he ordered,
      &ldquo;and let me know.... I believe you are in error, gentlemen, but I will do
      what I can for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal and Natividad went out, followed by the Minister, whose
      enormous spurs made the hall and staircase echo. Garcia closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what it all means,&rdquo; he mused aloud, evidently much put out. &ldquo;Ten
      to one, Oviedo Runtu is in it. If he really has carried off señorita de la
      Torre, the outlook for us at Lima is bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and an officer announced the British Consul. This
      official was a big tradesman of the town, who had secured the commissariat
      contracts to Garcia&rsquo;s army by promising him the support of Great Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia began to speak of his soldiers, and the consul put in that the
      worth of an army resided more in the general who commanded it than in the
      men themselves. His compliment provoked a self-satisfied bow from Garcia,
      but he made the mistake of trying to improve it, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For, between you and me, Excellency, those troops of yours are not worth
      much, and if you had not been there to...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not worth much! What the devil do you mean! Do you know what kind of
      fighting they have been doing in the mountains? Not worth much, indeed!
      Did you see a single laggard...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but the guard are all sound asleep now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep!&rdquo; Garcia swore, and ran to the door.

      door, and looked down the staircase, where he both heard and saw his
      guards sleeping. Pale with anger, the Dictator woke them, and ordered the
      officer to muster his men on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soldiers never sleep!&rdquo; he declared to the consul. &ldquo;Look at them. Do
      they look as if they wanted sleep?... Come, my lads, a little exercise to
      keep you fit. Out of that window with you all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His outstretched arm pointed to the bedroom window, nearly five yards
      above the ground. The poor hussars looked at him, hesitated, and jumped.
      Remained only the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what are you waiting for, major? You should be with your men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the officer did not move, he seized him round the waist, and
      threw him out of the window. The watching ministers and the consul,
      anxious not to take the same route, laughed heartily at the jest, and went
      to look into the courtyard. Those of the soldiers who had landed more or
      less safely were picking up three comrades with broken legs. The officer
      was being carried off, his skull fractured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as this interlude ended, the Minister for War returned, still
      followed by the Marquis and Natividad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Garcia, closing the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Red Ponchos,&rdquo; replied the Minister, looking meaningly at his
      illustrious chief. &ldquo;Oviedo Runtu quartered them there, and added a few
      soldiers to the guard. They leave to-morrow night for the Cuzco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else?&rdquo; Garcia was nervously twisting his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know nothing of the young lady and the little boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; burst in the Marquis, who could contain himself no longer,
      &ldquo;you must have that house searched. I know they are in it. You cannot
      allow those scoundrels to go free! Your name would be tarnished for ever
      if you did such a thing! It would make you the accomplice of
      murderers!....On you depend the life of my son, the only heir of a great
      name which in the past has always fought for civilization, side by side
      with yours, and of my daughter, whom you once loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter consideration might have had little effect on the Dictator, who
      did not believe in confusing love and politics, but the sentence before,
      appealing to his sentiments as the representative of &ldquo;a great name&rdquo; moved
      him powerfully. He turned bruskly to his Minister for War.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have seen something. I presume you searched the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I forced that house, Excellency, every one of our Quichua soldiers
      would rise. Runtu has only to make a sign, and they cut all our throats.
      That house is sacred, for the Red Ponchos and the mammaconas are escorting
      the &lsquo;sacred imprints from Cajamarca to the Cuzco for the Interaymi fêtes.
      It is impossible, Excellency.&rdquo; One look from the Dictator drove all his
      ministers from the room. When the door had closed on the last one, he
      turned to the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your children are in that house, señor, it is terrible... but I can do
      nothing for you.&rdquo; Don Christobal staggered under the blow, and leaned
      against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Garcia,&rdquo; he said in a strangled voice, &ldquo;if this horrible crime is
      allowed, I shall make you personally responsible for it before the
      civilized world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reeled, almost on the point of fainting. Garcia ran to his side, and
      held him up, but Don Christobal seemed to regain his forces at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands off, you general of murderers!&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia went white, while the Marquis walked toward the door, turning his
      back on the Dictator though he expected to be stabbed at any moment. But
      Garcia controlled himself, and his lisping voice checked Don Christobal in
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not go yet, señor. I can do nothing for you, but I can at all events
      give you some advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal turned, but ignored the hand which waved to a chair, and
      waited. He had already wasted too much time here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;time passes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any money?&rdquo; asked Garcia bruskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money? What for? To...&rdquo; He was on the point of saying &ldquo;to bribe you,&rdquo; but
      stopped at a suppliant look from Natividad, who was signing desperately to
      him from behind the Dictator&rsquo;s back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia, remembering there was somebody else in the room, took Natividad by
      the arm, and put him out of the room without a word. Then he sat down at a
      little table loaded with papers, rested his head in his hands, and began
      to speak in an undertone, without looking at the Marquis, still standing
      and suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do nothing for you against the Red Ponchos and the mammaconas.
      Their house, or their temporary quarters, must be sacred, for they have
      the relics of Atahualpa with them. You say your children are in that house
      as well. That may be, but I am helpless to prove or disprove it. It is
      horrible, I agree, but I am powerless. You say that my soldiers are
      guarding the house? That is not true. I am nobody in all this. Who put
      them there? Oviedo Runtu. They are Oviedo Runtu&rsquo;s soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Oviedo Runtu? A bank-clerk whom you may have had dealings with at
      Lima? Yes, and no. He is a bank clerk, but he is also the master of every
      Quichua in the country. Yes, he dresses like a European, and earns a
      humble living among us, but meanwhile he is studying all our institutions,
      our financial methods, all our secrets. He earns two hundred soles a month
      behind a counter, and he is perhaps a king. I don&rsquo;t know. &ldquo;King or
      not, all the Quichua and Aimara chiefs are his slaves. Huascar, your
      former servant, is his right hand.... If you ask me, a man who has dreamed
      the regeneration of his race! That&rsquo;s what he is.... When I was preparing
      this revolt at Arequipa, Huascar came and offered me Oviedo Runtu&rsquo;s aid,
      and I accepted the alliance because I could not do otherwise. Do you
      understand now? It is not I, but Oviedo Runtu.... He is in your way, as he
      is in mine.... And, believe me, I am as sorry for you as for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man. I can see his hand in it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I said before, force is out of the question. But though I cannot fight
      the Red Ponchos, <i>you</i> can bribe them. They are Quichuas, and any
      Indian can be bought. That is why I asked if you had any money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have none,&rdquo; replied the Marquis, who had been listening to the
      Dictator eagerly. &ldquo;We left in a hurry, and I had not time to think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately, though, I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Garcia whistled in a certain manner, and the Minister for Finance came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the war chest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the bed, Excellency.&rdquo; The Minister went down on his knees, and
      dragged an iron-bound box to Garcia&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they were alone again, Garcia took a little key from his pocket,
      opened the box, and took out a bundle of bank-notes, which he threw on the
      table. Locking the box, he pushed it under the bed again, picked up the
      notes, and handed them to the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count them afterwards, and pay me back in Lima, when I am President.
      There is enough there to bleach every Red Poncho in existence. They are
      gentlemen who know the value of those little pieces of paper. Oviedo Runtu
      himself probably taught them. Good-by, señor, and good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; said the Marquis, forgetting that a moment before he had
      called this man a murderer, &ldquo;I do not thank you... but if I succeed...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know... your life and fortune are mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more. I shall try to bribe your troopers with the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means! By all means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if we fail, Excellency, I warn you that weak as we are, desperate as
      the venture may be, we shall attack those priests and their escort. Can we
      count on your neutrality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly. And if by chance you injure Oviedo, I shall not have you
      hauled up before a court-martial!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands, and the Marquis ran out. As he crossed the threshold,
      Garcia shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His daughter is lost, but he, the fool, has been bought by me. All this
      would not have happened if she had married me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom of the staircase, the Marquis found Natividad waiting
      anxiously. In the street, they met Dick, who had come to look for them. He
      was pale and agitated, and it was evident that some extraordinary event
      had made him leave his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; asked the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to the inn, quick! We must decide on some course of action. What did
      Garcia say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he could do nothing for us. But he gave me money and a piece of
      advice that may save them. But what made you leave your post? Are they
      still there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Only one person has left the house. Huascar. I followed, determined
      to corner him, and kill him like a dog, if need he. He went straight to
      our inn, and asked for you. They told him you had gone out, but were
      returning. He then said he would wait, so I came to fetch you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are saved!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Christobal. &ldquo;Why else should Huascar come
      to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the man, and don&rsquo;t believe in him. You must not forget that
      you have to do with a fanatic, and one who owes Maria-Teresa a grudge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife found him starving in the street, and gave him shelter. I cannot
      believe he has altogether forgotten that.... I have always thought he was
      in the whole business against his will, and determined to save
      Maria-Teresa sooner or later. Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re right, but I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
      him cornered in a minute, and if he doesn&rsquo;t answer my questions properly,
      he&rsquo;ll be sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not forget, Dick, that they have hostages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hostages which they will massacre even if we let Huascar go free, sir! I
      would give anything to wring his neck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, boy, would give anything to save my children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis&rsquo; tone was so icy that Dick refrained from further comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before they reached the inn, Natividad noticed on the opposite
      pavement a tall old man leaning on a shepherd&rsquo;s crook, and watching the
      door through which Huascar had entered. A ragged cloak hung over his thin
      shoulders, and a straggling white beard framed a face so white that it was
      deathlike. Natividad stopped, and looked at him hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that face,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Who is it? Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal, entering the inn, told Dick that he was going to their
      room, and asked him to bring Huascar there. The stairs leading up to the
      first floor were just inside the archway, and the Marquis, putting his
      foot on the first step, noticed Natividad staring across the road. His eye
      followed, and he also was struck by a sudden vague memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who on earth is that?&rdquo; he wondered. &ldquo;I have seen that man before.&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ardly had the
      Marquis entered the room than Huascar made his appearance, followed by
      Dick and Natividad, like a prisoner with his two guards. The Indian swept
      off his hat, with a grave &ldquo;<i>Dios anki tiourata,</i>&rdquo; To wish a white man
      good-day thus, in the sacred Aimara language, was a sign of great respect.
      Then, seeing that the Marquis did not respond to the greeting, Huascar
      began to speak in Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Señor, I bring you news of the señorita and your son. If the God of the
      Christians, whom the benefactress worshiped, aids me, they will both be
      restored to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal, though seething within, forced himself to the same calm as
      the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you and yours committed this crime?&rdquo; he questioned, crossing his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you and yours commit the crime of not watching over them? Had you
      not been warned? Huascar, for your sake, twice betrayed his brethren, his
      god, and his country. He remembered that the mother of the señorita once
      befriended a naked child in Callao. That is why he has sworn to save her
      daughter from the terrible honor of entering the Enchanted Realms of the
      Sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal half held out his hand, but the Indian did not take it,
      smiling sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracias, señor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my son, Huascar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son is in no danger. Huascar watches over him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you watch over them! But to-morrow I may have neither son nor
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither son nor daughter will you have if you do not obey Huascar.&rdquo; The
      man&rsquo;s tone had become somber and menacing. &ldquo;But if you obey, I swear by
      the head of Atahualpa, who awaits your daughter should I betray her, I
      swear by my eternal soul, that the señorita will be saved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. You must abstain from all action. Do not pursue the Red Ponchos
      and put them on their guard. I will do everything if you and yours promise
      not to come near that house again. They know you, and when you appear, the
      mammaconas form the black chain round the Bride of the Sun. If a stranger
      appeared, they would offer her up to Atahualpa dead, rather than see her
      escape. Be warned, and do not leave this inn. If you promise me that, I
      swear that I will bring your son here, unharmed, at midnight. For your
      daughter, you must wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal took down a little crucifix from a nail over the bed, and
      came toward Huascar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The señora brought you up in our holy faith,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Swear upon this
      that you will do as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Huascar held out his hand and took the oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sworn,&rdquo; he said proudly, &ldquo;but for me, your word is enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have it,&rdquo; replied Don Christobal. &ldquo;We await you here at midnight.
      Gentlemen,&rdquo; he added, as Huascar&rsquo;s steps rang on the staircase without, &ldquo;I
      have given my word, and you must help me keep it. I believe in Huascar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added Natividad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick was silent. He had been watching the Indian, and was unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. Perhaps I am mistaken, though. I feel that Huascar hates
      me, and I do not love him particularly. We are not in a position to judge
      one another. Midnight will show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natividad, going to the window, had opened it, and was leaning out into
      the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I have seen that face somewhere before,&rdquo; he reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; added the Marquis, going to the window as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick joined them, and watched the skeletonlike old man across the street
      He was tracking Huascar, like a little boy playing at brigands, childishly
      taking ineffective cover behind carts, pedestrians and trees. The Indian
      had noticed him, and turned once or twice; then continued on his way
      openly, quite unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the Marquis, pensively leaning against the window, straightened
      himself with an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Orellana! The father of Maria-Cristina de Orellana!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natividad started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. That&rsquo;s who it is.... I remember him well now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They remained as if stunned by this apparition from the terrible past;
      this ghost come to remind them that he too had had a beautiful daughter;
      that she had vanished ten years before, during the Interaymi, and that he
      would never see her again. The Marquis, crushed by a flood of old
      memories, sat inert in an armchair, deaf to Natividad&rsquo;s reassuring words,
      and refused to touch a mouthful of the meal prepared for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, at the Marquis&rsquo; exclamation, had dashed down into the street, caught
      up with the mysterious old man at the corner of the square, and put a hand
      on his shoulder. The stranger turned, looking at the young man fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you desire, señor?&rdquo; he asked in a toneless voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know why you are following that man.&rdquo; Dick pointed to Huascar,
      just disappearing at another corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not know, then? The great day of the Interaymi is near. I am
      following that man because he commands the Red Ponchos, who are taking my
      daughter to the Cuzco. She is the Bride of the Sun, you know. But this
      time I shall not let her die! I shall save her, and we will return
      together to Lima, where her fiancée is waiting. Adios señor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stalked away on his long legs, leaning on the crook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad!&rdquo; said Dick aloud. Then he clenched his fists as if to hold his own
      reason. This inaction would drive him insane! To think that in the very
      heart of a supposedly civilized city there was nothing to do but to wait
      And wait for what? Huascar&rsquo;s good pleasure; his good pleasure to keep his
      word or break it. Could he force that house alone? He could at all events
      try, and fight his way to Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s feet, even if he was killed the
      minute afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and pulled himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      What good purpose would that serve? No, he must wait; wait until midnight,
      when Huascar would return. That was the only thing to do; ruse for ruse,
      and the golden voice of money to talk to those Indians. But midnight was a
      long way off. Ten times the young man paced round the square, wondering
      and raging. Surely there were behind all these beflagged and festooned
      windows a legion of Christian men who would rise like a hurricane if they
      knew the abominable truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick&rsquo;s thoughts were interrupted by the appearance of a dancing, singing,
      howling mob at the end of the neighboring calle. This, then, was the
      populace which he would have raised against Garcia, and which obeyed
      Garcia, while the Dictator, like Pilate, washed his hands of it. The mob
      approached, to the thunder of drums and bugles, while flaming torches and
      swaying paper lanterns lit up the scene, for night had now fallen.
      Overhead fluttered banners adorned with crosses and strange symbols
      perhaps two thousand years old. Christians, this crowd? Perhaps!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a man of the upper classes was to be seen, not even a high-caste
      Indian. Here were only the dregs of the city; a mass of howling maniacs,
      whirling and whooping round a huge bonfire which had flared up in the
      center of the square, their wild yells punctuated by salvas of cohetes
      (crackers). On one side of the square they were singing hymns; on the
      other they were drinking, smoking, swearing. One group of natives swept
      into a church, still dancing; another entered the theater and became
      religiously silent, awaiting the arrival of Garcia, for whom a gala was
      being given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, arms crossed and brows knit, glared at the passing groups. There was
      nothing to be done with such brutes as these! Then he took a sudden
      resolution. To the four winds with Huascar and his promises! He would go
      to that little adobe house! Feeling to see if his revolver was safe in his
      pocket, he turned, only to be confronted by Huascar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Señor, where go you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put a hand on the engineer&rsquo;s arm, restraining him. Dick roughly
      shouldered the man away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know where I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the Indian intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to the inn, señor,&rdquo; he advised calmly. &ldquo;I will be there in two
      hours&rsquo; time with the little lord. But if you make another step I cannot
      answer for the safety of your betrothed.&rdquo; Huascar&rsquo;s voice had changed as
      he said &ldquo;your betrothed.&rdquo; Dick, looking up quickly, saw nothing but hatred
      in the Indian&rsquo;s eyes. Maria-Teresa is lost, he thought despairingly. Then
      a flash of light seemed to illumine the abyss into which he felt himself
      rolling with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huascar,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;if you save Don Christobal&rsquo;s daughter...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped a moment, for his heart was beating as if it would burst. In
      those few seconds of silence, which seemed an eternity, the barbaric
      picture of that scene became imprinted on his brain for all time&mdash;this
      dark archway under which they had instinctively drawn, the somber and
      deserted street before them, the intermittent uproar from the plaza mayor,
      and, in the adjacent streets, the banging of cohetes thrown by mischievous
      boys under the feet of all that passed. Just opposite, at a window on the
      first floor, half-a-dozen globules of colored fire flickered in the
      darkness; a family of royal Arequipenos had been illuminating in honor of
      Garcia before going to see the torchlight procession, or to the gala at
      the Municipal Theater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick waited until an Indian, loaded down with horse-cloths, had passed and
      vanished; perhaps, sub-consciously, he was awaiting the miracle which
      would render unnecessary what he was about to say. The Indian waited,
      motionless as a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you save her, I swear to you by my God that she shall never be my
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Huascar did not answer at once. He was evidently taken by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall save her,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Return to the inn, señor. I shall be
      there at midnight.&rdquo; He turned and walked toward the river without another
      look at Dick, who made his way back to the plaza mayor, his ears buzzing,
      convinced that he had delivered Maria-Teresa.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>bsorbed by his
      thoughts, shaken by the mental storm through which he had just passed,
      Dick did not notice what was happening about him, and was nearly ridden
      down by a detachment of hussars clearing a way to the theater. The hussars
      were escorting an open carriage drawn by four splendidly caparisoned
      horses, and seated in the carriage were two men: General Garcia, in all
      the glory of the fullest of full uniforms, and beside him, in immaculate
      evening-dress, Oviedo Runtu.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw the Indian, Dick made as if to rush after the carriage, but he
      was swept away in a swirl of the crowd and, hardly knowing how, carried
      right into the theater on that human flood. He at once tried to escape,
      but could not battle his way back to the door. Garcia, surrounded by a
      glittering staff, was bowing to the cheering crowd from the front of the
      presidential box. Dick was so placed that he could not see Oviedo Runtu.
      The Indian, modestly hidden behind a column, left Garcia to wrestle with
      his glory alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A French actress, &ldquo;of the Comédie Française,&rdquo; if the bills were to be
      believed, came before the footlights and recited Spanish verse, in which
      Garcia was hailed as &ldquo;the Savior of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the curtain rose, revealing a pedestal, on which was the bust of a
      general. It had served several times before for a like purpose, but this
      time it was supposed to represent Garcia. Round it was grouped the whole
      company, which intoned a triumphal chorus. Then, one by one, the actors
      filed past the bust, each with his little speech and a wreath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bust was almost buried in flowers when an Indian girl appeared. She
      was wearing the Quichua costume:&mdash;a little tunic open at the neck,
      and a dozen skirts of various colors worn one on the other; over her
      shoulders, a woolen mantlet, secured at the throat by a spoon-shaped
      brooch.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was greeted with a roar of delight by the Indian part of the audience.
      And she, in her turn, that nothing might be lacking in Garcia&rsquo;s triumph,
      sang something in Indian, something by which the Indians also put all
      their hope and trust in the Savior of the Country. At the last verse she
      shouted, as was only meet, &ldquo;Long live Garcia!&rdquo; the crowd taking up the
      echo. There were other voices, however, shouting, &ldquo;Huayna Capac Runtu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gorgeous din followed. Every Indian in the theater jumped up, cheering,
      joined by scores of half-breeds who suddenly remembered their descent and,
      tired of being treated with contempt by the whites, joined in the roar of
      &ldquo;Long live Huayna Capac Runtu!&rdquo; The purely Peruvian element sat motionless
      in stalls and boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in the presidential box, Garcia had drawn to his constellated
      bosom the resplendent shirt-front of the bank-clerk, embracing before all
      the illustrious descendant of the Inca kings. The house, enthusiastic
      before, became delirious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gala was over, and Dick was carried out of the theater as he had been
      swept in. He had seen enough to realize how useless had been the Marquis&rsquo;
      visit to the Dictator. Garcia was helpless without the Indians, and the
      real master of the situation was Oviedo. Dick had now no hope but in
      Huascar. It was eleven o&rsquo;clock, and he hurried back to the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he found Natividad and the Marquis equally anxious at his protracted
      absence. As to Uncle Francis, nobody had seen him since the arrival at
      Arequipa, and nobody worried about him. Dick told them of his meeting with
      Huascar; he was convinced now of the Indian&rsquo;s good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not exchange another word until midnight, anxiously peering out
      of the windows for some sign to confirm their hopes. Natividad was as
      anxious as his two companions. He was a kind-hearted man, and had gone so
      far into the adventure that he could no longer withdraw without loss of
      self-esteem. Moreover, he was so compromised, administratively speaking,
      that, all things taken into consideration, he could not do better than
      stand by the Marquis to the end. Whatever the result, he was sure that Don
      Christobal would not let him starve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midnight came, and the twelve strokes rang out from the church tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theater had long since given up its last enthusiasts, and the square
      was now more or less deserted. All the paper lanterns had gone out, but
      the night was a clear one, and they could easily distinguish the shadows
      moving homewards under the arcades. None of them, though, came toward the
      inn. A quarter past twelve. Not one of the three men in the room dared say
      a word!
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past twelve, still nothing! The Marquis heaved a strangled sigh.
      At a quarter to one, Dick went over to the little lamp smoking on the
      table, took out his revolver, and opened it to see that it was loaded and
      working properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huascar has fooled us like children,&rdquo; he said, vainly striving to control
      his voice. &ldquo;He came here in broad daylight, with the knowledge of his
      accomplices, and threw sand in our eyes. He has kept us quiet for hours
      that were priceless to them, and might have been to us. I have no hope
      left. Maria-Teresa is lost, but I shall see her again if I die for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the room. Don Christobal, catching up his cloak and arming himself
      as well, followed, Natividad in his wake. They crossed the square in
      silence. At the top of the alley leading down to the adobe house,
      Natividad asked the Marquis what he intended to do against fifty armed
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first man we see will be offered a thousand soles to speak. If he
      refuses, a knife in the ribs. Then we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the point where they had been stopped by Civil Guards
      earlier in the day, they were astonished to find the sentry gone. For a
      moment, there was a flicker of hope in their hearts, but when they had
      advanced another twenty yards and saw the house unguarded, they realized
      the truth. They ran forward and entered the open door. All the rooms were
      deserted. In one of them they found the same pungent odor as at the
      hacienda on the Chorillos road. &ldquo;They are lost,&rdquo; muttered Natividad, while
      the Marquis, breaking down at last, called his children&rsquo;s names aloud
      through the deserted house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, exploring the place, fell over a crouching figure, and put all his
      pent-up rage into throwing the man. Half strangled and trembling with
      fear, the captured half-breed explained that he was the owner of the
      house. He had been roistering in the city, but the threat of death sobered
      him and loosened his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just after eleven o&rsquo;clock, a closed carriage had driven up to the door. He
      did not know who had entered it, but it had been escorted to the station
      by all the women and the Red Ponchos. This he knew for certain, because he
      had followed them out of curiosity. At the station, the man they called
      Huascar had given him some money, telling him to go away and not to return
      to the house before daylight &ldquo;The blackguard!&rdquo; growled Dick. &ldquo;He knew we
      would come here when he didn&rsquo;t turn up! Come on! To the station, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached it, it was with the greatest difficulty that they
      finally unearthed an employee asleep on a bench. He made no secret of the
      fact that a large number of Indians had left at a quarter past eleven, in
      a special train ordered by Oviedo Runtu &ldquo;for his servants.&rdquo; No, they could
      not get another special train that night for all the money in the world.
      If they wanted to get to Sicuapi as well, they would have to wait until
      the morning. This said, he returned to his interrupted nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night was a terrible one for the three men. They made another vain
      attempt to reach Garcia, and then wandered through the streets until dawn.
      Don Christobal was beginning to talk incoherently, and showed all the
      signs of approaching dementia. Again and again Dick led them back to the
      adobe house and wandered through the empty rooms. The half-breed had taken
      to his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natividad was not in a much better condition than his companions, and when
      the first morning train started, it carried three specters in one
      compartment. Other travelers, hesitating at the door, literally bolted
      when they saw their wild eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train went as far as Sicuani, but they did not reach it the same day,
      being obliged to pass a night at Juliaca, nearly ten thousand feet above
      sea-level, where they again found the trace of the Red Ponchos. It was
      intensely cold, and all three were taken with mountain sickness, which
      made them so weak that they were forced to take some rest. They only
      partially recovered next day, at Sicuani. There was a motor service
      between Sicuani and Cuzco, which was working despite the revolution, but
      the Marquis, unwilling to trust anybody or anything, bought a car for
      himself at a fabulous price. He was also moved by the thought that it
      might prove useful later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they were leaving the station road in their motor, they met Uncle
      Francis, cool, unperturbed, and fresh as a daisy. An avalanche of
      questions did not ruffle his calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I lost you at Arequipa and did not know what to do. Then I said to
      myself; &lsquo;They are sure to be somewhere near the Red Ponchos.&rsquo; We are
      following them, are we not? So when I saw one, I stuck to him like a
      leech. I followed him to a little house near the river, which was guarded
      by soldiers. That, said I to myself, must be where these dear children are
      being kept prisoners. You did not appear, and I thought you had gone
      ahead. Everybody knows where these ceremonies take place, I suppose. But I
      did not, so I stuck to my Red Poncho. When they went to the station, I
      followed. Somebody told me it was a special train and I couldn&rsquo;t get in,
      but I gave the guard two soles and slept in his van. When we arrived, I
      couldn&rsquo;t see you anywhere. I went on to Cuzco, but you were not there
      either. So I came back to meet this morning&rsquo;s train. And here I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Francis does not realize to this day how near he came to being
      strangled by his dutiful nephew, or stabbed by the Marquis. His superb
      calm nearly drove them frantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did they take Maria-Teresa?&rdquo; demanded Dick, roughly, though he owed
      the unconscious tracker more thanks than blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well enough! To the House of the Serpent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The House of the Serpent!&rdquo; Dick turned, to Natividad, gripping his
      sleeve. &ldquo;I have heard you say something about that place. What does it
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that they are in the Antechamber of Death.&rdquo;

      I
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>aria-Teresa opened
      her eyes. What was this dream from which she had awakened, or into which
      she had fallen? Little Christobal&rsquo;s plaintive voice brought her keen
      realization of the brutal truth. She held out her arms to the child, but
      felt neither his kisses nor his tears on her face. Her eyes were still
      heavy with magic sleep, and she opened them with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, gradually, she came out of the abyss of darkness and dreams into
      which she could be plunged almost instantly by the sacred sachets always
      ready in the hideous fists of the three living mummies; the mammaconas,
      too, had terrible perfumes which they burned round her in precious vases,
      sandia more pungent than incense, more hallucinating than opium, which
      transformed the Bride of the Sun into a beautiful living statue. Then they
      could sing their songs uninterruptedly, for Maria-Teresa had gone to
      another world, and heard nothing of what happened about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, her spirit then carried her back to the hour when the
      knock had come at her window in Callao and when, dropping the big green
      register to the floor, she had run to meet Dick. She was worried, too, by
      the ever present memory of an unfinished letter to their agent in Antwerp,
      which she had been writing when that other knock at the window had sent
      her running to Dick again. She remembered with horrible distinctness the
      appearance of the three living mummies, swaying in the darkness, and the
      feel on her mouth and face of the hands made parchment-like by the eternal
      night of the catacombs. Waking from this lethargic slumber, she thought
      she had shaken off a dream, but when her eyes opened, she no longer knew
      whether she had not just entered into a terrible dreamland.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Maria-Teresa opened her eyes this time, she was in the House of the
      Serpent. She knew, for the mammaconas had told her, that when she awoke
      there she would be near unto death. There it was that Huayna Capac, father
      of the last King of the Incas, would come to fetch the bride offered to
      Atahualpa, and take her with him to the Enchanted Realms of the Sun. In
      the lucid moments left to her during the voyage, when she was given the
      nectar that kept her alive, the mammaconas had taught her the duties of
      the Bride, and the first principles of the faith to which she was to be
      sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Maria-Teresa had hoped that she would be happy enough to lose
      her reason, or that the terrible fever which took her would free the
      troubled soul before the body was taken to martyrdom. But the mammaconas
      knew the secrets which cure such fevers, and had given her to drink a
      reddish liquid, chanting the while: &ldquo;Fever has spread over you its
      poisoned robe. The hated race shall never know our secrets, but our love
      for Atahualpa&rsquo;s bride is greater than our hatred. Drink and be well, in
      the name of Atahualpa, who awaits thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she had returned to life, only to die again, and so, a nerveless
      statue, she had traveled right across Peru, to the little adobe house at
      Arequipa, the last stopping-place before the House of the Serpent. There
      she had seen Huascar for the first time, bearing in his arms something
      covered with a veil. Careless of all the listening ears about her, she had
      risen, and called to him as to a savior. He had answered: &ldquo;Thou belongest
      to the Sun, but before he takes you, thou shalt have a great joy. Thou
      shalt see thy little brother again.&rdquo; Then he lifted the veil and showed
      her Christobal, sleeping. She had run forward, while he had retreated in
      terror. None but the appointed may touch the Bride of the Sun, and the
      three guardians of the Temple were there, armed, and swaying gently. One
      of them signed to a mammacona, who carried the sleeping boy to his sister;
      she burst into tears, for the first time since her captivity. The child
      opened his eyes and clung to her, sobbing, &ldquo;Maria-Teresa! Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he come here? You would not hurt him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall do as he wishes. He came to us, not we to him. He himself shall
      decide his fate. Let him beware of his words. That is all I can say to
      you, all I can do for you. Is that not so, ye Guardians of the Temple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa, clutching the child to her, looked at them with fresh terror
      painted on her features; at Huascar, calm and motionless; at the three
      living mummies, gently swaying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? How can a child beware of his words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Huascar, without moving, then spoke to little Christobal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, will you come with me? I will take you to your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I will stop with Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child has spoken,&rdquo; said Huascar. &ldquo;So it is ordered. Is it not so,
      Guardians of the Temple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three horrible skulls swayed gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Huascar, before leaving, had chanted the words of an Almara psalm:
      &ldquo;Blessed are those who shall come pure to the Kingdom of the Sun, pure as
      the hearts of little children, at the dawn of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huascar, have pity! Remember my mother! Have pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Huascar bowed to the Guardians of the Temple and went out silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa, crooning over little Christobal, covered him with kisses.
      &ldquo;Why did you come, little one? Why did you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you not to be afraid, Maria-Teresa. Papa and Dick are coming.
      They are following, and will save us both. But if you must die, little
      sister, I will die with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mammaconas, moving silently, had lit the sandia in their precious
      vases; brother and sister slept together, in each other&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she had awakened in the House of the Serpent, and Christobal was not
      with her. She struggled to regain consciousness, heard his cries near by,
      and rose from the cushioned couch on which she had been reclining. There
      was Christobal, naked, struggling in the hands of the mammaconas.
      Terrified, she made as if to rush to his assistance, but six of the women
      surrounded her, calmed her with fluttering hands. No harm would come to
      the child; he was being dressed, as she would be dressed, in a robe made
      of bat skins. They spoke with infinite respect, giving her a title she had
      not heard before; they called her Coya, which, in Inca, means queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mammaconas took her in their powerful arms, lifting her like a child,
      and took off the sulphur-hued robes with which she had been adorned in the
      deserted hacienda. Again they anointed her with sweet oils and perfumed
      creams, chanting the while a slow and restful lullaby, stilling to the
      senses. They were tall women from the province of Puno, born on the shores
      of Titicaca, strong and beautiful; their walk was almost rhythmic, supple
      and harmonious, while their rounded arms showed golden against the black
      of their veils. They had splendid eyes, all that could be seen of their
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa and little Christobal were afraid of them, but they were not
      cruel. Two of their number were to die with Maria-Teresa, to prepare the
      nuptial chamber in the Palace of the Sun, and they were the most lively,
      the happiest, the most consoling and understanding. They were wholly
      happy, and were sad that the Bride did not share that happiness, doing all
      they could to make her understand the joy of being chosen among all as the
      Goya. On their ankles they wore great golden bracelets, and in their ears
      heavy circlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was no longer crying. They had promised him that if he was good
      he would return to Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s arms. She also obeyed the mammaconas
      docilely. The chant with which they filled her ears lulled her spirit,
      still heavy with the magic sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a thought, too, which gave her courage. Those who were dearest
      to her knew where she was, what had happened to her, who had carried her
      off, and why. If little Christobal had been able to find her, surely her
      father and Dick could do so. They would both be saved. If Dick had not
      appeared before, it was because he delayed until he was sure of success.
      At any moment they might appear with the police and soldiers, all these
      savages would vanish in the mountains, and the horrible dream would be
      ended. She felt as weak as a child face to face with Destiny.

      with fruits, and when they are ripe the branches bend down to the earth,
      that the Indian need not even raise his hand to pick them. Do not weep!
      Thou shalt live eternally, eternally! Death knocks at the doors of the

    <p>
      On Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s perfumed tresses they placed the royal borla, its golden
      fringe overshadowing her eyes and giving her a strange hieratic beauty.
      She shivered when the bat-skin robe slipped over her limbs; it was as if
      she had donned something viscous and icy, which from that instant made her
      part and parcel of the eternal night of which the bat is Coya.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they placed on her wrist a circlet which she recognized as the Golden
      Sun bracelet. She realized that her last hours had begun, and thought
      sadly of the happy yet terrible day when this bracelet first appeared in
      her existence; she remembered the horror-stricken face of Aunt Agnes, the
      old duenna crossing herself, her father&rsquo;s skepticism and Dick&rsquo;s loving
      laugh. Where were they all now? Why&mdash;why did they not come to her
      rescue?
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa stretched out her arms to the Providence that seemed to have
      deserted her, and closed them again on little Christobal, placed in her
      lap by one of the attendants. When she saw him, clad like herself in the
      robes of night, she was seized with revolt. This could not be! She turned
      to the Guardians of the Temple, who came forward in answer to her look,
      gently swaying. There was no doubt of it! There were the same horrible
      skulls which Dick and she had seen taken out of the earth, come from their
      tombs to take her back with them. But she <i>would</i> speak, and test
      their mercy. She turned away her eyes, mortally afraid that the steady
      swaying would overpower her will, and told them she was ready to die
      quietly, as befitted a Bride of the Sun, if only they would spare the
      little boy and send him safely back to Lima.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not leave you, Maria-Teresa! I will not leave you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child has spoken. So it is ordained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Guardians of the Temple exchanged glances and moved away again, gently
      swaying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa burst into tears, the ring of madness in her high sobs, while
      the little boy clung desperately, striving to console her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not cry, Maria-Teresa! They will come to save us. Papa and Dick will
      come.... Oh! What was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From behind the walls come the strains of music. A curtain is raised, and
      the players enter&mdash;tall, sad-faced men who take their places in a
      ring around them. They are the sacred players of the quenia, the flute
      which is made of human bones. Their song is sadder than a De Profundis,
      and Maria-Teresa shivers, her beseeching eye exploring in vain every
      corner of the great bare room which is the antechamber of her tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monstrous, Cyclopean masses of stone, hexagonal in shape and placed one
      upon the other without mortar, held in place by their mighty weight alone,
      form the walls of the House of the Serpent. She knows where she is, for
      the mammaconas have told her. There are two Houses of the Serpent, one at
      Cajamarca, the other at Cuzco. They are called thus because of the stone
      serpent carved over the main entrances. The serpent is there to guard the
      sacred precincts, and never allows the victims of the Sun to escape. Aunt
      Agnes and old Irene have often told her this, and until now she has always
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa, then, is in Cuzco, in a palace well known to travelers,
      historians, and archaeologists; a place which all may enter, which all may
      leave in freedom; a place to which guides bring the curious stranger. Then
      what does it all mean? Why should she fear? They are sure to come to her
      rescue. But why are they still not here?
    </p>
    <p>
      Which way will they come? Listen! Yes, above the sad piping of the quenias
      rise other sounds: murmurs, footsteps, and the dull rumble of a gathering
      throng. It comes from over there, from behind that vast curtain, that vast
      golden-yellow curtain which stretches right across the room and prevents
      her from seeing. What does it hide, and what is that crowd awaiting?
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa questions the two mammaconas who are to die with her. They
      are stretched at her feet in their long black veils, and rise with respect
      to answer. The faithful are waiting to adore King Huayna Capac, who will
      come to lead her back to Atahualpa. Maria-Teresa, uncomprehending, asks
      more questions. He will come from the bowels of the earth to claim them,
      and they will pass through the realms of night in their robes of mourning,
      till they reach the Enchanted Realms of the Sun. Then they will be clad
      all in gold, with golden dresses and jewels of gold, for all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the little boy?&rdquo; asked Maria-Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her horror, they turned their heads away and did not answer. She caught
      Christobal more closely to her, covering his face with kisses, as if she
      wished to smother him with caresses to save him from a more terrible fate.
      The child strove to console her. &ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Papa
      and Dick will come, not the wicked King. They will soon be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On one of the giant stones are mysterious signs to which the whispering
      mammaconas draw each other&rsquo;s attention&mdash;strange sculptured figures
      with the head of man and the body of the coraquenque. In all time and on
      all the earth, so say the Incas, there has been only one couple of
      coraquenques, two of the mystic birds which appeared in the mountains at
      the coronation of each new king and gave him two of their feathers to
      adorn his head-dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the curtain, the noise has ceased, and the song of the quenias
      suddenly grows so piercing that Maria-Teresa cries out in terror.
      Christobal, clutching at her bosom, nestles closer. Then the curtains are
      parted, and the whole hall is revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, a long way below her, is a prostrate and silent crowd. On the
      porphyry steps which stretch down to this crowd stand the three Guardians
      of the Temple. A step below them, Huascar, his arms crossed under his red
      poncho. Lower still, four prostrate Red Ponchos, who are the Guards of the
      Sacrifice. Their heads, completely hidden by the sacred bonnet and
      ear-caps, are bent so low that none can see their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely there is somebody in that huge crowd who will free her!
      Maria-Teresa, filled with a wild hope, rises with the child in her arms,
      and cries for mercy. But the booming answer takes away all hope. &ldquo;Muera la
      Coya! Muera la Coya! To death with the Queen!&rdquo; They give her the title in
      Aïmara, but clamor for her death in Spanish, that she may understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four mammaconas on her right, the four others on her left and the two
      who were to die with her surrounded the young girl, forced her back to her
      seat. But she still struggled, holding up the boy, and begging that he at
      least might be spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the sacrifice of Pacahuamac,&rdquo; came the answer. And the mammaconas,
      taking up the echo, chanted: &ldquo;The sacrifice of Pacahuamac! Before all
      things began, before the Sun and before the Moon, his sister, was the
      Great Spirit, Pacahuamac. Pacahuamac, the Great Spirit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down below there, the surging crowd took up the cry. Huascar, turning,
      commanded silence with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all standing now, except the four Red Ponchos on the last step;
      still prostrate and silent. The cry of the quenias rose again, strident
      and shrill; soon they alone were to be heard. Maria-Teresa, crushed,
      conquered, had ceased struggling. Not a voice, not a sign, had answered
      the appeal. In a groan, she begged the mammaconas for their perfumes.
      &ldquo;Have mercy. Bring your perfumes. Then we shall not suffer.&rdquo; The two who
      were to die with her shook their heads. &ldquo;We must go to Atahualpa waking,
      with all our hearts and all our senses, that heart and senses may live
      hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quenia players ceased their music, and a terrible, gripping silence
      descended on the hall. The faithful fell to their knees, and Huascar&rsquo;s
      sonorous voice commanded silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! Silence in the House of the Serpent! The dead King is coming!
      Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as if an earthquake had shaken the walls. The place was filled with
      thunder. But instead of coming from the heavens, it rose from the very
      bowels of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Christobal trembled in his sister&rsquo;s arms, clung closer, and
      whispered, &ldquo;Look, Maria-Teresa! Look at the Red Ponchos.&rdquo; She lifted her
      eyes, looked, trembled, and forced herself to silence. While every other
      head was bent in worship, the Guards of the Sacrifice had raised theirs,
      and under the sacred bonnets, despite the stain that disguised them,
      Maria-Teresa recognized the faces of Dick, her father, Natividad and Uncle
      Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she looked a second time, the four bonnets were prostrate again, and
      a cry from Huascar, herald of Huayna Capac, brought the multitude to its
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another tremor shook the very foundations of the temple, and one wall
      seemed to vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huayna Capac!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat part of the
      wall on which were sculptured the strange signs and the two human-headed
      birds had opened, as if on a pivot. Maria-Teresa cowered and covered her
      face with her hands, for the dead king was emerging from the gulf of
      shadow beyond. The wall swung back into position, and the young girl,
      opening her eyes again, saw before her a two-seated throne of massive
      gold. The seat on the right of the dead majesty was unoccupied. The great
      crowd of Indians was bent to the dust in adoration, while the dirge of the
      quenia-players rose to the roof in ever-increasing volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two mammaconas who were to accompany Maria-Teresa to the Enchanted
      Realms of the Sun stood on each side of her, while the ten other
      priestesses, formed in two lines, passed and re-passed before her, in the
      intricate steps of a sacred dance. When they came before the Dead One&rsquo;s
      throne, they fell to their knees, then rose again, chanting: &ldquo;This is
      Huayna Capac, King of kings, son of the great Tapac Inca Yupanqui. He has
      come by the Corridors of Night to claim the new Coya offered by the Inca
      people to his son Atahualpa.&rdquo; Then they moved backwards, crossing and
      re-crossing, swaying their black veils. Twelve times they repeated this
      movement, and each time the chant grew louder, while the purl of the
      quenias swelled and broadened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa, holding Christobal closely to her, stared fixedly at Huayna
      Capac, and the Dead One seemed to stare back at her. He also wore the
      bat-skin robe made for the Corridors of Night, but beneath it could be
      seen the royal mantle and the golden sandals. His face, calm and severe,
      majestic in its still beauty, nearly had the hues of life; it was framed
      in masses of coal-black hair, crowned with the royal borla in which
      quivered the plumes of the coraquenque. Under the half-closed lids the
      eyes seemed living. The dead king was seated naturally, his hands resting
      on his knees, and so life-like was his whole attitude that to
      Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s horrified eyes he seemed to be breathing. Only little
      Christobal heard her half-strangled cry, for the mammaconas were repeating
      their chant for the twelfth time, and with the piercing note of the
      quenias, deadened all other sound in the House of the Serpent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down below there, the mob of Indians was swaying, swaying gently from
      right to left, in imitation of the rhythmic movements of the three
      Guardians of the Temple. Maria-Teresa kept her eyes fixed on the dead
      king, not only because he was just opposite her and, half fascinated, she
      could not do otherwise, but also because she did not wish to look at the
      Red Ponchos. She felt that if her eyes were allowed to wander for an
      instant, they would fatally betray the four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa was now as if half buried in the idea of death; she felt as
      if the earth had already claimed her, only leaving her head free for a
      little longer. She was becoming gradually hypnotized by the motionless
      monarch, while the fanatical crowd about her wondered, awestruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huascar raised his arm, two fingers of his right hand imposing immediate
      and absolute silence. The Guardians of the Temple drew near, pointing
      towards the vacant seat on the golden throne. Two mammaconas lifted up
      Maria-Teresa, carried her to it, and placed her beside Huayna Capac, son
      of the great Tapac Inca Yupanqui. Then the double throne was turned until
      it faced the assembly and the Red Ponchos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa closed her eyes, shivering at the thought of the corpse
      beside her. She dared not open them, realizing with horrible distinctness
      that if she did she must try to run down to Dick, or call out something
      that would betray them. Though her eyes were closed, and she outwardly
      seemed as dead as the mummy beside her, Maria-Teresa knew what was
      happening. Little Christobal, peeping over the curve of his sister&rsquo;s arms,
      was watching everything, and a whisper, so low that she hardly felt the
      breath rising along her bare neck, said: &ldquo;Dick has lifted his head....
      Papa is looking at us... we must not move.&rdquo; Maria-Teresa pressed her
      trembling fingers on the child&rsquo;s lips, and he was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they were there. Her tired brain, working, working, wondered what they
      were going to do. It was horrible to know them there, hidden and helpless.
      For if they had not been helpless, they would not be hidden, they would
      have come with police and soldiers. Could it be that the Indians were
      masters of the country now? Then she thought of the revolution, of Garcia,
      who had once loved her. Why had they not gone to him? At a word, he would
      have come with his whole army. And they, hidden under their red ponchos,
      what could they do? What was their plan?
    </p>
    <p>
      The mammaconas were chanting:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Earthquakes shook the world. The moon was girt with rings of many colors.
      Thunder fell on the royal palace, and reduced it to ashes. An eagle, hard
      pursued by falcons, circled over the great square of the city, filling the
      heavens with his cries. Pierced by the talons of his foes, he fell dead at
      the feet of the noblest among the Incas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, recalling the defeat and death of their last ruler, all
      bent their heads, groaning, and the breath of the quenia players trembled
      in the dead men&rsquo;s bones. Huascar had also bent to the ground; then he
      raised his forehead and his eyes met those of Maria-Teresa. She shivered,
      and when he moved toward her, she thought her last hour had come. She had
      been able to appeal to the mercy of the crowd, but she could not call to
      this man, whose look showed that he loved her. She closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huascar&rsquo;s voice reached her, slow, cadenced, and monotonous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coya, thou belongest to Huayna Capac, the great King who will take thee
      to the House of the Sons of the Sun. We leave thee alone with him. He will
      lead thee through the Corridors of Night, which no living man must know,
      and in the temple will seat thee among the Hundred Wives. Thou must obey
      him, thou must rise only if he rises! Thou must obey. And remember that
      the serpent watches in the House of the Serpent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew, still facing her, with the three Guardians of the Temple,
      while the great crowd below flowed silently through the three doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the mammaconas followed, drawing their black veils over their faces,
      like widows leaving a cemetery. Even the two who were also to die left
      her, first bending to kiss her feet, peeping shoeless from under the
      bat-skin robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness was rapidly gaining the hall. Why were they leaving her alone
      there? What was this horror which even they dared not see? She must not
      rise unless he rose. Would this dead thing come to life, then, take her by
      the hand, and lead her into the eternal night? What of the Red Ponchos?
      She looked. They were still there, prostrate at the foot of the steps. The
      Guards of the Sacrifice, she had heard them called. They were stopping! A
      surge of joy filled her heart She felt less afraid now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Guardians of the Temple had left. Huascar had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would the Red Ponchos follow? No, they did not move. She was watching them
      now, with her whole soul. They were still there, motionless, ready to
      spring to her rescue when the hall was empty, ready to carry her to the
      horses that must be waiting. The Dead One at all events could do nothing
      to prevent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only twenty Indians left in the hall now... only five...
      four... three.... They turned slowly at the doorway to look at her
      again... She sat motionless, rigid.... She must not move unless the Dead
      One moved.... Only the four Red Ponchos remained....
    </p>
    <p>
      She half screamed.... They also had risen, pacing slowly toward the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could not be! They could not be deserting her! But they were going away
      like the others, without looking in her direction. No, she must not
      scream... she must wait patiently... wait for a sign. Still walking
      slowly, three of them had gone to the three doors, but the fourth, Dick,
      turned suddenly, his finger on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgetting Huascar&rsquo;s words, Maria-Teresa half rose in her seat. There was
      a revolver in Dick&rsquo;s fist now, and her father had vanished through one of
      the doors, looking to make sure that the courtyard was deserted. Then his
      voice gave the signal:&mdash;&ldquo;Recuerda!&rdquo; (Remember!) Dick dashed up the
      porphyry steps, Don Christobal following, while the two others remained at
      the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Maria-Teresa! Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick stretched out his hands to take little Christobal, and Maria-Teresa
      had risen, when a terrible whistling sound filled the hall, and the two
      prisoners, shrieking, were hurled back into the seat by the monstrous
      folds of a huge serpent which seemed to spring into life about them,
      binding them down to the throne of Death. The serpent of the House of the
      Serpent had come to claim his prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising his revolver, Dick thundered at the hideous head towering above
      them, whistling with wide-open jaws, and tore at the coils which
      imprisoned his fiancée. His hands fell, not on living flesh, but on hard,
      cold metal; copper rings which ground one against the other, overlapped,
      and drew tighter. It was in vain that he and Don Christobal tore at them
      with furious hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out! They are coming!&rdquo; shouted Natividad from the doorway, and the
      hall was invaded by Indians, while the Serpent shrieked stridently, and a
      thousand rattles seemed to sound the alarm. The Marquis still tore at the
      coils that were choking his children, but Dick, hesitating a moment,
      dashed down the stairs. In a twinkling, the hall was full of Indians,
      priests, caciques, mammaconas, scores of Quichua soldiers from the train
      of Oviedo Runtu, who alone remained invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huascar appeared, still calm and immovable, as if this scene did not
      surprise him, as if nothing could surprise him. Had he known beforehand
      what was to have happened, he could not have given his orders more
      deliberately. Don Christobal, Natividad, and Uncle Francis were tied up in
      a trice, the latter at last alarmed by the brutality of his captors. Dick
      had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them away,&rdquo; ordered Huascar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal struggled, turned and looked once again. &ldquo;Maria-Teresa!
      Christobal!&rdquo; Then he too was hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Huascar, more and more somber, directed the search for Dick.
      They hunted in vain; he had disappeared like a drop of water in the sea.
      Finally, Huascar gave the order to clear the hall again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone with the Guardians of the Temple, who stood caressing the
      serpent&rsquo;s folds with their hideous little hands, the high-priest went
      behind the throne. In a moment, the brazen monster was silent, loosened
      its grip, and shrank link by link, until it vanished whence it had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going to the wall, Huascar placed his hand on the coraquenque, and the
      massive stones rolled back; the throne shook, slipped backwards, and
      vanished down the Corridors of Night, taking with it the dead King,
      Maria-Teresa and little Christobal, both unconscious. The wall closed upon
      them, hiding again the secrets which only those who are ready to die may
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Guardians of the Temple bent their monstrous heads in obeisance before
      Huascar, and in their turn went out Huascar, last High-Priest of the
      Incas, was alone in the House of the Serpent Slowly going to the top of
      the porphyry steps, he sat down. His head dropped between his hands, and
      there he remained till dawn.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ick, clear of the
      House of the Serpent by what was little short of a miracle, crouched down
      in a niche of the palace wall, hewn out by some dead Inca hand, and there
      waited for Huascar throughout the night, watching the door at which he
      must appear. He was careless of the danger he ran, and his very boldness
      saved him. Not one of the passing Quichuas, dignitaries of the Interaymi,
      dreamed for an instant that the poor Indian wrapped in his poncho, and
      apparently asleep, was the sacrilegious stranger who had slipped from
      their clutches. The darkness, too, favored him, as it had favored his
      daring escape; he had merely turned his red poncho inside out, so that it
      looked like any other poncho, and had joined the howling crowd, stopping
      in it until Huascar&rsquo;s order had cleared the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argue the matter as he would, the young man saw no hope. Garcia&rsquo;s victory
      over the Federal troops at Cuzco had given the district into the hands of
      the Indians. The Spanish population, only an eighth of the 50,000 souls in
      the ancient city, had fled. Never since the Spanish Con quest had the
      Quichuas so completely been the masters. Garcia himself had prudently left
      the town, waiting for the end of the Interaymi; and the few troops he had
      left behind him were heart and soul with the native population, from which
      they had been levied, and with which they shared customs, faith and
      fetichism. In a word, the Cuzco was as much the home of the Incas as it
      had been in the heyday of their despotic rulers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dick and his companions had reached the outskirts of the city they
      had hidden their motor in a half-deserted country inn, bribing the
      landlord. They had at once realized that force was out of the question.
      Happily, there remained Garcia&rsquo;s money. The landlord, a poor half-breed
      who asked no better than to become rich, had listened readily, and the
      offer of a small fortune had set him off looking for Red Ponchos willing
      to betray Huascar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found four, the very men who were to be the Guards of the Sacrifice, in
      the House of the Serpent. When these men had explained their functions,
      the four Europeans could hardly believe their good fortune. Dick and Don
      Christobal were so absorbed by the idea of getting through to the
      prisoners somehow, that they did not stop to think how suspiciously easy
      their task had been. Uncle Francis, a witness of the bargain, was for once
      not altogether wrong when he shrugged his shoulders at their childish
      scheme to &ldquo;take him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Red Ponchos agreed to everything, and the price was fixed, and they
      received half-payment. The remainder was to be handed over when the
      Marquis&rsquo; children were free. The traitors promised to help them escape
      from the sacred precincts, and moreover brought them their disguises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Francis, chuckling covertly, accepted the part assigned to him with
      such readiness, showed such quiet courage in his attitude, that he
      reconquered at one stroke the lost esteem of both the Marquis and his
      nephew. Natividad, ever ready to believe anything to the discredit of an
      Indian, and knowing from experience how easily they were to be bought, was
      quite confident in the success of the expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoroughly fooled by Huascar, they had walked into the trap, and only
      amazing luck had saved one of them. Where were the others now? Where was
      the dungeon that held them, and what was to be their fate?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick was waiting in the dark street before the palace, determined to shoot
      Huascar when he saw him. All night through, nobody came out of the House
      of the Serpent. At dawn, the young engineer suddenly felt a hand on his
      arm, and, looking up, recognized the old man to whom he had spoken at
      Arequipa, the father of Maria Cristina de Orellana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you stop here?&rdquo; asked the stranger. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see the procession
      if you do. Follow me, and I&rsquo;ll show you my daughter coming out of the
      Corridor of Night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick stared at him. Groups of Indians were passing, all heading in the
      same direction. The old man spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may as well go with them. They are all off to see the procession of
      the Bride of the Sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick followed him mechanically. Why not, after all? He was nearly mad
      himself. Why should a madman not be his guide? As they walked, Orellana
      babbled on tonelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you well. You want to see the Bride of the Sun. I see you have
      even disguised yourself as an Indian to do so. Not in the least necessary,
      I assure you. You&rsquo;ll see her, right enough, if you come with me. I know
      Cusco, below ground and above ground, better than any living man. I have
      lived in their secret passages for ten years. When I am not under ground,
      I guide strangers through the city, and show them where the Bride of the
      Sun used to pass on her way to the Temple of Death. You know that, of
      course? It&rsquo;s the same as the Temple of the Sun, only underneath. I&rsquo;ll show
      it you, for it&rsquo;s worth seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine fêtes this year, señor. Last time, they had to hide themselves in
      the Corridors of Night, but to-day they are masters both above and below,
      and that dead king of theirs, Huayna Capac, will see daylight again.
      They&rsquo;ll take him all through the city, as they used to do. If you don&rsquo;t
      know that, you haven&rsquo;t been keeping your ears open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your friends? I could have shown it to them as well. And I
      don&rsquo;t charge much; a few centavos keep me going for weeks. All the
      innkeepers know me, and send for Orellana when they have visitors. I know
      you all quite well. I saw you at Mollendo, then at Arequipa, and now here
      you are again outside the House of the Serpent. That&rsquo;s where they always
      go first. Yes, that&rsquo;s the way they brought Maria Cristina ten years ago.
      She was the prettiest girl in Lima, so they chose her for their god. I
      didn&rsquo;t know then, but this time they won&rsquo;t have their way quite so easily.
      When I saw the Interaymi come round again, I said to myself: &lsquo;Orellana,
      you must get ready for them.&rsquo; And I&rsquo;m ready for them, never fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus they crossed the whole city. Dick, walking like a man in a dream,
      following to the next station in the martyrdom of his sweetheart, paid no
      heed to the wonderful ruins on all sides of him, the mighty buildings
      piled rock on rock by demi-gods, and which have not moved, nor will move
      until the earth dies, long after the winds of heaven and the quivering of
      the mountains have stamped flat the miserable huts left by the
      Conquistadors.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the city behind them and Orellana, taking Dick by the hand, like
      a little child, made him climb the mount which the Quichuas call the Hill
      of the Dancing Monkey. Its gigantic summit, hewn into terraces, galleries
      and giant stairways by long-dead craftsmen, was already crowned with
      Indians. All eyes were turned toward that other miracle of Inca work which
      is Sacsay-Huaynam, a hill of stone fashioned into a Cyclopean fortress,
      with three lines of defenses rising one above the other, each wall dotted
      with niches from which on this day, as of yore, armed sentries looked out
      over the country. On the summit of Sacsay-Huaynam towered the Intihuatana,
      or &ldquo;the pillar on which the sun is bound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orellana&rsquo;s broken voice explained it all to Dick, guide-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This pillar, señor, was used by the Incas to measure time. A religious
      stone, erected to mark the exact period of the equinoxes. That is why they
      call it Intihuatana; it means where the sun is bound.&rsquo; Look over there!
      You can see the procession starting.... Don&rsquo;t you understand? The
      Corridors of Night run right under the city, from the House of the Serpent
      to Sacsay-Huaynam. When my daughter comes out, they will take her round
      the hill, and round the Intihuatana. Then, when the Sun has been freed by
      the High-Priest, the procession will come down to the gates of the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick could now clearly see the procession forming up on the walls, and
      even distinguished Huascar at its head, giving orders. Leaving Orellana,
      he hurried toward Sacsay-Huaynam, getting as near as the press of Indians
      would allow. He could now see that the solstice pillar, placed in the
      center of a circle, was loaded with festoons of flowers and fruit, while
      on its summit stood a golden throne. The throne of the Sun, vanished
      centuries before, had been brought out from the Corridors of Night and
      replaced there before the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence on Sacsay-Huaynam; a few priests were grouped round the
      Pillar, waiting for the hour of noon. Then Huascar appeared, clad in
      golden vestments. Facing the throne of the Sun, the High-Priest waited a
      few seconds, turned and cried aloud in Aïmara a phrase which was taken up
      on all sides in Quichua and Spanish:&mdash;&ldquo;The god is seated on the
      Column in all his light!&rdquo; Then he struck his hands together, giving the
      signal for all to march; the god, having visited his people, had been
      freed, and continued his voyage through the heavens. The faithful followed
      him on earth, from east to west.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sacred procession sprang into life, led by Huascar. First came a
      hundred servitors of the god, simply dressed, whose task it was to clear
      the way, chanting paeans of triumph. After them, a group of men in
      chequer-board tunics of red-and-white, whom the populace greeted with
      shouts of &ldquo;The amautas! The amautas!&rdquo; (the sages). Then others all in
      white, bearing hammers and maces of silver and copper, who were the
      apparitors of the royal palace; the guards and the Inca&rsquo;s body attendants,
      their azure robes blazing with precious metals; finally, the nobles, with
      heavy ear-rings marking their rank. The procession wound slowly down from
      Sacsay-Huaynam to the plain, and then the double throne, borne on the
      shoulders of the noblest among the Indians, appeared to the multitude.
      Thousands of throats greeted the dead king and his living companion; a
      roar of mingled enthusiasm for the descendant of Manco Capac, and hatred
      for the conquering race, translated by deafening shouts of &ldquo;Muera la Coya!
      Muera la Coya!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa seemed to hear nothing; pale as marble and beautiful as a
      statue, she passed unheeding, little Christobal still in her arms. Instead
      of the bat-skin robes, they now wore vicuna tunics, sheer as silk. Behind
      them walked the two mammaconas who were to die, their faces veiled with
      black; the other women and the three Guardians of the Temple had
      disappeared. The cortège was brought up by a company of Quichua soldiers
      in modern uniform, rifle on shoulder, tramping to the lilt of the
      quenia-players, who closed the march.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast between this antique procession and that fragment of a modern
      army was more than curious. Uncle Francis, the only one who could have
      really appreciated it under the circumstances, was not there. As to Dick,
      he was watching Maria-Teresa with the fixed gaze of a madman. Strive as he
      would, he could get no nearer, and so backed out of the press to run
      toward the gates of the city, where he hoped to fight his way to the front
      ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last steps of the Hill of the Dancing Monkey he was immobilized by
      the press of people and forced to look with them to the summit of
      Sacsay-Huaynam, where, on the top of the highest tower, had appeared the
      scarlet figure of a priest, sharp-cut against the azure of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick at once recognized the Preacher of Cajamarca, and voices around him
      further explained that this was the chief officer of the quipucamyas, or
      Keepers of the Historical Word. His voice, sweeping down from
      Sacsay-Huaynam, checked the advance of the procession, chanted the glory
      of by-gone days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ringing clear and impassioned, it recalled the day when the Stranger and
      his diabolical train had first entered those plains after the death of
      Atahualpa. As to-day, the Sun blazed over the Imperial City, then full of
      altars sacred to his cult. Then, innumerable buildings, which the
      conqueror was to leave in ruins, traced white streets in the heart of the
      valley, and clustered on the lower slopes of the hills. In the conqueror&rsquo;s
      train was Manco, descendant of kings, in whose name he gave orders and was
      obeyed. On that day, when the sun went down behind the Cordilleras, it
      might well have been thought that the Empire of the Incas had ceased to
      exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it still lives!&rdquo; thundered the voice. &ldquo;The Sun still shines on his
      children; the Andes, cradle of our race, still tower to the skies; Cuzco,
      navel of the earth, still quivers at the voice of his priests;
      Sacsay-Huaynam and the Intihuatana are still standing; the procession of
      the Interaymi still starts from these sacred walls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, the procession moved on again, and had it not been for the
      anachronism of the riflemen bringing up the rear, one could almost have
      believed that five hundred years had brought no change in the plains of
      the Cuzco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, finally free to move on, was despairing of ever getting nearer to
      Maria-Teresa when he met Orellana again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; asked the old man. &ldquo;A place to see from? Then
      come with me, and I&rsquo;ll show you my daughter. I know Cuzco better than the
      Incas themselves. Come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again Dick allowed the madman to be his guide. They reentered the
      city by way of the Huatanay ravine, spanned to this day by the
      Conquistadors&rsquo; bridges, and entered a maze of side-streets free from the
      crowd. Skirting the prodigious Hatun Rumioc, or wall-which-is-of-one-rock,
      they passed Calcaurpata, which tradition makes the palace of Manco Capac
      himself, first King of the Incas and founder of Cuzco; then they turned
      toward the Plaza Principale, called Huàcaypata by the Quichuas of to-day
      as by the Incas of yore. To reach it, Orellana took Dick through the
      ruined palace of the Virgins of the Sun, detailing, as he went, the uses
      and names of the various rooms. The young man&rsquo;s impatient interruptions
      left him quite unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have plenty of time. You shall see my daughter from so near that you
      could speak to her. Stop a minute, and listen to the quenias. The head of
      the procession has no more than reached San Domingo. That church,
      curiously enough, was built on the very foundations of the Temple of the
      Sun.... I have never met a visitor less curious than you are.... This is
      the cloister of the Virgins of the Sun.... It has always been the home of
      virtue and piety, for the Christians turned it into a convent under the
      auspices of Santa Catarina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick, unable to stand the guide&rsquo;s jargon any longer, began to run toward
      the noise of the advancing procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might pay me!&rdquo; shouted Orellana in his wake. &ldquo;Pay me what you owe
      me!&rdquo; and stooped to pick up the centavos which the young engineer threw on
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearing the plaza principale, Dick again found his way blocked by the
      crowd, and forgot his anger in the relief of finding a friend when
      Orellana tugged at his poncho again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well stop with me,&rdquo; urged the old man. &ldquo;Hurrying won&rsquo;t help
      you. I know a little tiny Corridor of Night that will lead us to the Sun,
      right to the top stone of one of those temples.... It&rsquo;s a temple dedicated
      to Venus.... They call her Chasca, or the young man with the long and
      curly locks, and he&rsquo;s supposed to be the page of the Sun. Come with me.&rdquo;
       Orellana had taken Dick by the hand, and led him to a cellar, in which
      they found the foot of a narrow staircase. Once at the top of it, they
      were, as the old man had promised, on the summit of a ruined temple,
      dominating the crowded square below and the streets radiating to it like
      the spokes of a wheel to the huh. Around them were other ruins; temples
      sacred to the moon, to the &ldquo;armies of the heavens,&rdquo; which are the stars,
      to the rainbow, lightning and thunder... walls which still defied the
      elements, though the temples were now shops, work-rooms or stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head of the procession had appeared, the hundred servitors of the god
      pressing back the crowd, and slowly wound its way round the square. Then
      the golden litter came into sight and Huayna Capac, for the first time in
      centuries, came to the center of the world, the Umbilicus of which he had
      been lord and master. All heads were bowed before this sovereign shadow
      and the memory of ancient glories once again brought to life. The crowd
      even forgot for the moment its hatred of the stranger woman, the
      motionless Coya with the stranger child in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The double throne was brought to the center of the square, and the crowd
      rose with clamoring voices. Around the litter, the caciques and the
      chiefs, the nobles and the amautas, who are the sages, joined hands and
      began to circle, dancing as they danced of yore, when each man held a link
      of the golden chain and danced the Dance of the Chain. Hands made the
      links to-day, for when the Strangers slew Atahualpa, the nobles of the
      Cuzco threw that chain, which otherwise would have gone to the King&rsquo;s
      ransom, into the deepest water of Lake Titicaca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recuerda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as if from the heavens, this cry checked the rhythm of the Dance
      of the Chain. Maria-Teresa started on her throne, remembering the signal
      in the House of the Serpent. The child in her arms also lifted its head,
      and their eyes questioned the blue vault above from which this word of
      hope had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Dick&rsquo;s voice, Maria-Teresa! I told you he would come to save
      us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s eyes explored the towering walls about her, black with Indians.
      How could she recognize him in that crowd? Where was he? Again the voice
      rang out over their heads, so loud that it could be heard by the most
      distant unit of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recuerda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every head was turned upwards, and a threatening murmur rose from that
      human mass, torn from its dream of renascence and liberty by a single
      Spanish word. Recuerda! What must they remember? That they were slaves?
      That these fêtes, striving to recall an abolished past, could only last
      the space of a day? That the sun of to-morrow, forgetting that of to-day,
      would only shine anew on their servitude?
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa started up from the golden throne with the child in her arms,
      brought to life and action again by the beloved voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking higher, they at last saw, on the highest stone in the azure, a
      pigmy figure holding out its arms to the Coya, and crying, &ldquo;Maria-Teresa!
      Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then all understood that on high there was a stranger, one of the hated
      race, come to rob them of the soul of their Coya.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>andemonium reigned
      in the square. This was sacrilege unspeakable! Did not the Coya already
      belong to the gods! Muera la Coya! Death to the stranger! There was a huge
      rush, a scramble of raging Indians along parapets, over rocks and the
      ruins of temples, while the golden litter was hurried away by the Guards
      of the Sacrifice and the amautas. Maria-Teresa closed her eyes, carrying
      to the tomb that supreme farewell which was perhaps to cost Dick his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be mad,&rdquo; said the madman Orellana, when he saw Dick lean over
      and call to Maria-Teresa, and when she answered, asked almost angrily:
      &ldquo;How did you come to know my daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The roar of the angry crowd surged up to them, surrounded them, and drew
      nearer. It was with the greatest difficulty that Orellana shook Dick out
      of his strange torpor, dragged him through the gap from which they had
      emerged, and finally to the labyrinth below the Temple. Apparently
      familiar with every twist and turning of the place, he led him through a
      mile of passages, their darkness relieved here and there by round, square
      or triangular patches of light sifting down between thousand-year-old
      stones from the world above. Occasionally he stopped to tell Dick what
      temple, what palace, they were passing under.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yaca-Huasi, which they also call the House of the Serpent, is over our
      heads now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they have taken her there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! That&rsquo;s against all the rules. The Temple of Death is the next
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going to? Where are you taking me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Temple of Death, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick followed him without another word, but expressed his surprise when
      they emerged into the open country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the Temple, then?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the Island of Titicaca. You needn&rsquo;t be afraid. We shall get there
      before them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hired horses at a wayside inn and rode to Sicuani. Here they took a
      train which, turning onto a branch line at Juliaca, then ran to Puno, on
      the shores of Lake Titicaca. On the way, Orellana babbled ceaselessly
      about the country through which they were passing and the ceremony they
      were to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      No stranger has ever seen it. But he, Orellana, asked nobody&rsquo;s permission,
      and since his daughter was to be wedded to the Sun, it was the least of
      things that he should be present at the marriage, and particularly as he
      had planned it all so carefully! It had taken him years to find the Temple
      of Death, but with patience all things could be done. There was not one
      dried-up river-bed underground, not a deserted goldmine which he did not
      know so well that he could find his way about it with his eyes shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what fortunes he had discovered under the earth; a fortune equal to
      all the fortunes on earth! It was obvious that the Incas must have got
      their gold somewhere. Well, he had discovered where! There was plenty of
      it left, plenty of it left!... One day, some clever young engineer would
      find out, and he would only have to stoop to be as rich as Croesus. (A
      bitter smile from the young engineer, whose thoughts were far from such
      things.)... But he, Orellana, did not give a fig for all the gold in
      creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved only his daughter, whom the Indians had taken to the Temple of
      Death, and it was only the Temple of Death which he had sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had taken him years, but now everything was; ready and he was going to
      save her. He had waited long enough to kiss her again! Ten whole years!
    </p>
    <p>
      So the old man wandered on, while Dick listened eagerly, striving to guess
      how much was truth, and how much madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do they get from Cuzco to the Temple of Death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that.... By the Corridors of Night, by the
      Corridors of the Mountains of Night, by the Corridors of the Lake of
      Night.... By the way, do you know anything about fishing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick did not have time to answer this extraordinary question, for the
      guard had come through to their carriage, and was inviting them to the
      luggage-van to see the samacuena danced. Everybody else seemed to be going
      there, and they accepted so as not to draw attention to themselves. They
      found the van peopled with Indians, dancing, playing the guitar, and
      drinking hard. At each step, the guard, to celebrate Garcia&rsquo;s victories,
      fired a volley of cohetes, the mountains throwing back the echo of the
      explosions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then some of the Quichua soldiers in the train gave themselves up to the
      pleasures of the chase. Spying flocks of vicuñas in the hills, they went
      to the observation-car and tried their luck. One of them, something of a
      marksman, brought down a vicuña, the train stopped with a grinding of
      brakes, and the guard himself went off to retrieve the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, wild with impatience, would have liked to club the engine driver and
      take charge of the locomotive himself, but Orellana calmed him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sure to get there before them. You&rsquo;ll see! Why, we shall even have
      time to do some fishing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving their fellow-travelers to cut up the vicuña, they returned to
      their carriage, where the stove had been lighted. It had become intensely
      cold, for they were now in the snow regions, more than fourteen thousand
      feet above sea-level. Soroche, or mountain fever, threw the young
      engineer, and after bleeding violently at the nose, he fell into a
      semi-comatose condition. He did not recover until Punho, when he again
      remembered the horrible nightmare through which he was living, and
      savagely demanded to be shown the way to the Temple of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going there,&rdquo; replied his strange guide, but first took him to the
      main square, where about a hundred Indian girls, wearing skirts of a dark
      material and the low-cut bodices of their race, squatted in orderly rows,
      selling fruits and vegetables dried in the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are usually two hundred of them,&rdquo; explained Orellana, &ldquo;but the Red
      Ponchos have been this way and chosen the best-looking half for the
      ceremony. It&rsquo;s the same thing every ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a few purchases with Dick&rsquo;s money, and after adding a flask of
      pisco to his stores, led the way out of the city. At nightfall they
      reached a huge marsh, alive with water-fowl. Next they crossed a heath,
      llamas and alpacas fleeing at their approach, and finally came to a dismal
      little bay on the shores of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Titicaca, in its mountain cradle, is the highest lake in the world. That
      night, its waters looked somber and heavy, almost dead. A storm, growling
      in the distance, soon swept down on them with a howl of rain, the waves
      dashing up the beach mountain-high, and the lightning touching the
      surrounding peaks with fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid, splendid,&rdquo; muttered Orellana as the storm broke. &ldquo;That means
      fine weather for to-morrow. In the meantime, we may as well have supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had led the young man under a giant monolith, hewn to the shape of a
      door. In a niche of it, Orellana managed to light a dung-cake fire, and
      here they ate a little and warmed themselves with generous pulls at the
      pisco flask. Dick at last fell asleep, while the old man covered him with
      a horse blanket and paternally watched over his slumbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before dawn, Dick awoke to find Orellana reminiscent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This place has always brought me luck since I started to look for my
      daughter, but I cannot make out who to thank for it. Do <i>you</i> know
      who this god is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the bas-reliefs which covered the stone. They represented a
      human being, the head adorned with allegorical rays, and each hand holding
      a different scepter. Around this being were symmetrically ranged other
      figures, some with human faces, others with the heads of condors, all
      holding scepters, and all facing toward the center.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it,&rdquo; mused Orellana aloud. &ldquo;This is nothing like
      the Incas&rsquo; work. It is much more sculptural, and much older. There must
      have been worlds on these shores before the advent of the Incas. They&rsquo;re
      only savages who steal children.... Well, come on. We may as well go out
      in my boat and meet the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a little creek, half hidden by rushes, they found a cane pirogue, in
      which Orellana had soon hoisted a mast and a mat sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll do some fishing. It&rsquo;s all on the way to the
      Temple of Death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick followed him into the fragile craft, and they started for the
      islands. These came into sight late in the afternoon, a blue blur on the
      horizon. To Dick&rsquo;s fevered imagination, they seemed like threatening
      shadows on the face of the waters, ghostly guardians of the Temple of
      Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orellana refused to go any nearer that night, hauled down the sail, and
      threw overboard a heavy stone to anchor his boat. Then he handed Dick a
      fishing-rod. At his astonished look, the madman replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People come to the islands to fish, because these waters are blessed by
      the gods and the catches are better than anywhere else. Can&rsquo;t you do what
      everybody else does?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed across the waters to little lights flaring up at the bows of
      other pirogues, in which sat motionless fishermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All those Indians are fishing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may as well join them. If
      you can&rsquo;t, go to sleep, and don&rsquo;t worry us. You&rsquo;ll see something worth
      while when you wake up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orellana woke Dick just before dawn. The last stars were paling in the
      heavens at the approach of their King. The deep waters of the lake showed
      uniformly gray, not a light and not a shadow upon them. Not a sound to
      break stillness, not a breath of wind in the air. Suddenly, in the Orient,
      the mountain peaks were touched with fire, a giant furnace sprang into
      being behind the torn curtain of the Cordilleras, and the sun painted
      scarlet splashes into the shadows of the sacred islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they pass before the largest of them, which is Titicaca, the Indian
      fishermen in their fragile pirogues never fail to chant the Aïmara Hymn of
      the Ancestors, for it was from this island, untold years ago, that sprang
      the founders of the Inca race in the persons of Manco Capac and Mama
      Cello, husband and wife, brother and sister, both children of the Sun.
      Coming in sight of the island, the traveler perceives giant ruins and
      great masses of rock piled up in an inexplicable manner, so strange that
      science has not yet been able to give them a date. These are the baths,
      the palaces and temples of the first Incas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, staring landwards from the pirogue, hardly knew whether he was awake
      or dreaming. Was this a hallucination born of the terrors of the week, or
      did his eyes really reveal what other eyes had first adored centuries
      before, at the dawn of the Inca world? As the shadows of night drew away
      and the island stood out above the waters in all its terrestrial grandeur,
      he did not merely see dead stones, lifeless temples, and deserted palaces;
      the Cyclopean whole was peopled by a vast throng, motionless and silent,
      its myriad faces turned to the flaming Orient. This immobility and silence
      were those of a dream; there were thousands there who seemed to live and
      breathe only in the expectation of some mysterious and sacred event.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disc of the sun was still hidden behind the Andes, but all Nature
      heralded its approach; the flanks of the mountains were jeweled with a
      thousand dazzling stones, brooks and torrents were afire, and the broad
      bosom of the lake was a roseate mirror bearing the still reflections of
      palaces and temples. Virgins, bearing, as of old, the most beautiful
      flowers of the season and the emblems of their religion, peopled the
      porticoes. At the summits of towers, luminous with the dawn, priests
      waited for their god to show his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, he appears... he rises... he blazes down on his empire, and is
      hailed by a great roar. &ldquo;Hail, O Sun, King of the Heavens, father of men!&rdquo;
       Earth trembles, waters shiver, the heavens even quiver at the call. &ldquo;Hail,
      O Sun, father of the Inca!&rdquo; Arms are stretched toward him, hands heavy
      with offerings implore his intercession, and every voice chants his glory.
      &ldquo;Hear thy children! Hail, O Sun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cries and songs of triumph are swelled by the clamor of barbaric
      instruments, and the tumult grows as the radiant disc climbs higher in the
      heavens, bathing the multitude in light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sun, behold thy Empire! After so many centuries, the faithful, the men who
      labor in valley and mountain, are still here, and still do thee obeisance.
      The golden-armed virgins have poured libations from the sacred vases, and
      the hymns of the priests, after having risen to the heavens, now seem to
      plunge into the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is this miracle? The dream has vanished; vanished as do the light
      mists of morning before the first rays of the sun.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ick rubbed his
      eyes. What had become of that crowd? Who had hailed the god of Day? Now
      that the sun was high on the horizon, and that things had taken on their
      true shapes again, he could see only ruined palaces and solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orellana had driven his pirogue to the shore, and jumped onto the beach,
      signing to the young man to follow. As they neared the cliffs, he stopped
      him; the pious throng had vanished, but not in a dream, for the sound of
      chanting could still be heard from within the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;They have gone to the Temple of Death,
      but we shall be there before them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered a grotto. Dick had no will but Orellana&rsquo;s, and no hope. He
      was convinced that Maria-Teresa must die, and regarded that last greeting
      of theirs as the supreme one. Once certain that she had passed to the
      realms of night, he would follow her there. He had been told she was to
      end her life in the Temple of Death, and this old man, who ten years
      before had lost his daughter in the same way, said he knew where it was.
      Well, he would follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grotto was a deep one. After walking for a few seconds over sand and
      shells, the old man lit a resinous torch, and the spluttering flame showed
      the dark entrance of a passage. Before entering it, however, he bent down
      in a corner and picked something up. Dick saw that it was a pick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save my daughter, of course! Just come with me, and I&rsquo;ll show you. I
      shan&rsquo;t let those devils choke her as they did ten years ago. They wall
      them up alive, you see. All we need do is to wait until they have gone,
      and then take her out again. Clear enough, isn&rsquo;t it?... When I discovered
      the Temple of Death and saw all the slabs on the wall, I said to myself:
      &lsquo;It would have been easy enough to save her if I had been there.&rsquo; It was
      too late then. And of course, I didn&rsquo;t know which stone she was behind.
      This time, though, I shall watch them.... We&rsquo;ll get the best of them yet.
      See if we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was hope, then! Dick took a long breath, and steadied himself.
      Madmen with their set ideas are sometimes nearer the truth than sane men
      with their set reason. Dick took the pick, and followed Orellana down the
      winding passage, the torch in the old man&rsquo;s trembling hand throwing weird
      lights and shadows on their path. There was not a foreign sound to be
      heard. The earth had choked all noise as it might yet choke them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hacked through the stone, their corridor opened at intervals onto little
      square rooms, probably the burial-places of long-forgotten priests and
      dignitaries, slumbering there as their brethren of ancient Egypt slumber
      in the Pyramids. In the last of these rooms, Orellana put out the torch,
      and fell on his knees, for the narrow gut which they now entered was far
      too low for a man to stand upright in. A few yards further on, they came
      to a spacious niche, and stood up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are there,&rdquo; said the old man, stopping Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was far less dark here, and Dick, his eyes growing used to the
      obscurity, realized that a diffused light was reaching them from
      somewhere. The shadowy outline of columns and cornices gradually took
      shape, and he realized that he was looking down from a height of several
      feet into a vast hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the Temple of Death,&rdquo; said Orellana. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the distance came the sound of rhythmic chanting, and suddenly a
      blinding stream of light descended into the chamber before them.
      Instinctively, they threw themselves back into the darkest corner of their
      niche. Above them, at the summit of the vast subterranean hall, a stone
      had been removed, letting in the golden sunlight. In the heart of the
      vault was a kind of truncated cone, so fashioned that the sunbeams,
      sliding along its surface, were thrown into the farthest corner of the
      mysterious temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altars, altar-steps, and niches were heavy with gold, the plaques of the
      precious metal being bound together by a wonderful cement, to make which
      liquid gold had been used. This hidden temple was, in a word, a veritable
      goldmine.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the eastern wall was an image of the divinity, wrought in massive gold,
      and representing a human head surrounded by shafts of light. So the old
      world has also represented the sun. The heavy plaque was studded with
      emeralds and other precious stones. The rays of the rising sun fell full
      upon it, filling the whole temple with a light that seemed almost
      supernatural, and flashing back from the gold ornaments with which walls
      and vault were incrusted. Gold, in the poetic language of the country, is
      &ldquo;the tears shed by the Sun,&rdquo; and the Temple blazed with the precious
      metal. The cornices crowning the sanctuary walls were also of gold, and a
      frieze of gold, hammered into the stone, ran right round the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick and Orellana, from their coign of vantage, could see a number of
      chapels placed symmetrically round the great central chamber. One of them
      was sacred to the Moon, mother of the Incas. Her effigy was almost
      identical with that of the Sun, but the plaque was of silver, recalling
      the soft glow of that gentle planet. Another chapel was dedicated to the
      Armies of the Heavens, which are the stars and the brilliant court of the
      sister of the Sun; a third, to thunder and lightning, the terrible
      ministers of her wrath; yet another, to the rainbow. And in all these
      chapels, as in the temple, all that was not silver was gold, gold, gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young engineer&rsquo;s eyes gradually took in all the details of the temple.
      First, the central altar, several steps above the floor, on which were
      golden vases brimming over with maize, incense-burners, ewers for the
      blood of the sacrifice, and a great golden knife on a tray of gold. Then
      he realized that something living was moving in the hall, which he had
      thought deserted. The Guardians of the Temple, like three hideous gnomes,
      glided from altar to altar, while the one with the cap skull, given the
      taste for blood from his earliest years by this deformation of the
      cranium, urged the others to hasten, and every little while went to the
      main altar to pat the great knife waiting there. Behind the altar, and
      rising above it, was a kind of golden pyramid, crowned with a golden
      throne. &ldquo;That is for the King,&rdquo; said Orellana. On each side of the altar,
      and before it, were three other pyramids. But they were not so high, and
      were not of gold. They were of wood. &ldquo;The pyres,&rdquo; explained Orellana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pyres! What do you mean, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, steady! They&rsquo;re not going to burn her. She&rsquo;s the Bride of the
      Sun, and they wall her up. Burn her, indeed! It&rsquo;s not done, I tell you.
      Every Aïmara child knows that. Little children don&rsquo;t see the Temple of
      Death unless they are to die in it, but they know that much. Burn my
      daughter, indeed! As if I would allow it! What do you think I brought this
      pick for? You do just as well not to answer. Much better remain silent
      than talk nonsense like that. If you look at the walls out there you&rsquo;ll
      see a big porphyry slab between each gold panel. There are just a hundred
      of them, and behind each one is one of the Sun&rsquo;s brides. If I only knew
      which tomb my daughter was in, I would have had her out a long time ago.
      But the slabs are all just alike, and there is nothing to help a poor
      father in his search. This time, though, I&rsquo;m watching, and as soon as
      they&rsquo;ve gone, I shall save her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be dead, smothered alive, when you get her out.&rdquo; Dick, thinking
      hard while the old man babbled on in whispers, was hoping against hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That just shows how little you know about it. They are deep tombs, like
      cupboards, and you can sit in them. Don&rsquo;t you know the Indians always bury
      people sitting? There&rsquo;s air enough in there to keep her alive for an hour,
      or even two. And I shall have her out in ten minutes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick stared blindly at the porphyry slabs before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if there are a hundred of them in there already, there isn&rsquo;t room for
      another. Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am. You needn&rsquo;t worry, boy. The pyres are for the two
      mammaconas who go before the Bride to prepare her chamber in the Enchanted
      Realms of the Sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are three pyres, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. They have to take out the oldest bride to make room for my
      daughter. Then they burn her. What else should they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burn her? Then they do burn her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick had almost lost control of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old one, you fool!&rdquo; retorted Orellana testily. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you
      there were a hundred there? The Sun is given a new bride every ten years.
      Can you count, or can&rsquo;t you? That makes one of them a thousand years
      old.... There&rsquo;s no harm in burning a wife who is a thousand years old. The
      Sun has got tired of her by then. Doesn&rsquo;t he set fire to her pyre himself?
      That proves it.... Listen. Here they come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chanting grew louder, and soon the priests appeared. Behind them
      walked the nobles, recognizable by the heavy ear-rings which only
      descendants of an Inca may wear; they were dressed in sleeveless red
      tunics, and each man bore a banner on which was embroidered a rainbow, its
      brilliant hues varying to mark the coat-armor of each house. Next came
      young girls of noble family, who in the old days would have become Virgins
      of the Sun, ending their lives on the altars of the deity, or as the wives
      of the Inca. They were followed by their adult brothers, wearing the white
      robes, crosses embroidered on the breast, which were the traditional
      costume of men of their caste about to enter the order of knighthood.
      After them, the curacas, chiefs of the races conquered by the Incas and of
      all the tribes which had taken the oath of fealty. These men wore
      multi-colored tunics, unadorned with gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cortège had advanced to the center of the temple, and suddenly, as the
      chanting ceased, all turned toward the door by which they had entered. A
      strange silence succeeded the rhythmic throbbing of canticles. Then a
      terrible scream tore the air. Dick gripped Orellana&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to do with us. They&rsquo;re sacrificing a child in the Black Chapel of
      Pacahuamac, the Pure Spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he devils!&rdquo; Dick
      wrenched ont his revolver, but the old man gripped his wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet, you fool! We can&rsquo;t save the child now, and if you make a sign we
      shan&rsquo;t save her either. If you can&rsquo;t stand it, get out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young engineer controlled himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too horrible! Poor little Christobal! My God, why can&rsquo;t they kill us
      all and have done with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should be ashamed of yourself, talking like that,&rdquo; said the madman.
      &ldquo;When a man has nerves like a woman he shouldn&rsquo;t come to the Temple of
      Death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that one terrible cry, all was silence again. Nobles, virgins, young
      men and curacas continued their slow progress round the Temple. Behind
      them entered the amautas, sages who teach the children of the Incas; the
      Red Ponchos, who surrounded the altar like a sacred guard. None of them
      carried visible arms. The high dignitaries of the court followed, wearing
      the blanchana, a flowing tunic of light bark, painted in vivid colors.
      Each man carried a barbaric emblem with wide-open jaws, designed to
      frighten away all evil spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick thought that Maria-Teresa was entering, but then saw that the litter
      borne on the shoulders of nobles was occupied by a figure which he did not
      at first recognize. His robe and sandals seemed of solid gold, and his
      ears were weighted down with enormous ear-rings, reaching almost to the
      shoulders. About his head was the royal llantu, a multi-colored turban of
      delicate tissue, and his forehead was further adorned by the kingly borla,
      the heavy scarlet and gold fringe of which partly hid his eyes. Two
      coraquenque plumes towered above the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he descended from his litter, aided by two pages, and slowly mounted
      the steps of the golden pyramid, the assembly bent to its knees. At the
      summit of the pyramid, he paused gravely, took his seat on the golden
      throne, and gave the Aimara greeting:&mdash;&ldquo;Dios anki tiourata.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then all rose to their feet, while he sat motionless, like a graven image.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bank-clerk!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, as he faced toward the hidden watchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had before them Huayna Gapac Runtu, King of the Incas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The god is seated in all his light!&rdquo; chanted the assembly in unison,
      repeating the words three times. Then the wail of the quenias filled the
      air, and the religious cortège entered the temple, led by the four Guards
      of the Sacrifice, their heads erect now, for the sacred bonnets hid no
      secret. Behind them walked another Red Poncho, bearing in his hands a mass
      of knotted cords. Dick recognized the Preacher of Cajamarca, head of the
      quipucamyas, or Keepers of the Historic Word. Then came Huascar, in the
      saffron-colored vestments of the high-priest, preceded by lesser
      dignitaries of the church, while four curacas held over him a canopy of
      brilliant-hued plumes. All bowed before Huascar; the Inca alone was above
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the high-priest&rsquo;s stern face and somber eyes, Dick looked to his
      hands, to see if they were red with the blood of sacrifice. He felt a wild
      desire to shoot him down there, to kill him like a mad dog among his
      priests and servitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mammaconas advanced, chanting. He could not at first see Maria-Teresa,
      hidden from view by black veils, rhythmically waved about her. The
      movement ceased and the women parted, leaving the way clear for the two
      among them who were to die and who advanced with uncovered faces, smiling
      like happy children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quenias ceased their song, and the second litter was brought forward
      in solemn silence. Dick shivered. Was Maria-Teresa dead or alive? He hoped
      vainly that her litter might pass close to him, as had Huascar&rsquo;s canopy.
      From where he was, she seemed as inert and lifeless as the mummy monarch
      beside her, and little Christobal was no longer in her arms. That part of
      her face left uncovered by the golden robe and head-dress was tomb-like in
      its pallor, and her eyes were closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The double throne was set down between the altar and the pyres; Huascar
      took his seat on the right of the altar, and the chief of the qui-pucamyas
      on the left; the mammaconas stood on the altar-steps. The two who were to
      die, their black veils discarded for dainty holiday attire, with flowers
      in their tresses, knelt at Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s feet. The nobles and the curacas
      were ranged round the temple with the virgins and young men. The three
      Guardians of the Temple closed the doors. No others might enter, for the
      common people, forbidden the sight of these mysteries, waited far away, in
      the Corridors of Night, until the priests should return to lead them back
      through the labyrinth to the light of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huascar rose, and his sonorous voice opened the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the beginning was Pacahuamac, the Pure Spirit, who reigned in the
      darkness; then came his son, the Sun, and his daughter, the Moon; and
      Paeahuamac gave them armies, which are the Stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unto the Sun and Moon were born children. First were the Pirhuas,
      king-pontiffs; then the Amautas, pontiff-kings; and then the Incas, kings
      of kings, sent on earth to rule mankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assembly repeated Huascar&rsquo;s words like a litany. When it was ended,
      young men brought a llama to the altar, and the Guardians of the Temple
      offered up the sacrifice. Huascar bent over the entrails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gods are propitious,&rdquo; he announced to the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from the throne, the chief of the quipucamyas rose to his feet,
      and in a few verses recalled the chief terrestrial episodes of the history
      of the Incas, the assembly chanting other verses in reply in the same
      monotonous rhythm, while the priest slipped the knots of the quipus
      through his fingers like a monk telling his beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the verse recounting Atahualpa&rsquo;s martyrdom, a great shout
      went up in the temple. The King, from his throne, raised a sceptered hand,
      and spoke. The end of the bondage placed upon his people by the gods was
      near; he, Huayna Gapac Runtu, had been chosen by the Sun to drive out the
      strangers; and as a gage of his reconciliation with the faithful, the god
      had permitted them to offer him in sacrifice the noblest and most
      beautiful virgin of the hated race, a descendant of one of those who had
      murdered Atahualpa.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the King&rsquo;s words, all eyes were carried to Maria-Teresa, and a roar of
      &ldquo;Muera la Coya!&rdquo; beat round her. Was she not already dead, then? The
      savage cries did not even make her eyelids quiver. If she was still alive,
      she must be unconscious. Dick, falling to his knees, thanked heaven for
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the King&rsquo;s voice rose, telling the people that the day of
      deliverance was near; that their empire would be re-born in all its
      splendor. The altars of their god, served for centuries in the darkness,
      would soon smoke anew in his light. Once again would they be the Free
      Children of the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the Children of the Sun advance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young men approached the royal throne. For thirty days they had gone
      through the tests of yore; they had fasted, fought, displayed their skill
      in wrestling and with arms; they had worn coarse clothing, walked
      barefoot, and slept on the hard floor. Now they advanced in their white
      robes, the cross on their breasts, like young knights of the Middle Ages
      in the Gothic cathedrals of another faith and land.
    </p>
    <p>
      They surrounded the golden pyramid and
    </p>
    <p>
      Huascar, taking evergreen branches from a golden vase held by two virgins,
      bound them in their hair as a sign that the virtues they had acquired must
      last for all time. Then, one by one, he called their names to the King,
      who, as each young man knelt before him, pierced his ears with a golden
      awl. They descended, their white robes smeared with blood, while Huascar,
      from another vase, took heavy ear-rings, with which he adorned them.
      Nothing in the young faces betrayed their suffering. Then all raised their
      hands and took the oath of bravery and of fealty to the Inca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Let them now put on their sandals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This part of the ceremony was performed by the quipucamyas, the most
      venerable among them strapping on the young men&rsquo;s feet the sandals of the
      Order of the Incas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; repeated the King. &ldquo;Let them be given their girdles.&rdquo;
       Again the old men passed down the ranks, buckling on the heavy war-belts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said the King for the third time. &ldquo;And I say unto you
      before the dead King and the Goya who is to die, that they may repeat it
      to your ancestors, that our race is still the first of all living races,
      for you are the pure Children of the Sun, without earthly leaven, the
      brother having always drunk the blood of the sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The virgins advanced, taking the places of the young men on the steps of
      the throne, while fathers and brothers intoned the Aïmara Song of Triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The savages! The savages!&rdquo; raged Dick, thinking only of vengeance now
      that he thought Maria-Teresa was dead. He balanced the revolver in his
      palm, hesitating. There were at all events Huascar and the King he could
      bring down; that would be some satisfaction. But suppose Maria-Teresa was
      not dead after all? He might still save her. For a moment he thought she
      had moved. He questioned Orellana in a whisper. &ldquo;My daughter is very
      tired, and must be sleeping,&rdquo; replied the madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the cap-skulled Guardian of the Temple had made a little
      incision on the throat of each virgin, gathering their blood in a gold
      ewer. When the cup was full, he touched it with his lips and handed it to
      the young men, among whom it passed from hand to hand, while the girls,
      proud of their light wounds, cried, &ldquo;Glory to the Children of the Sun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cup is empty,&rdquo; announced Huascar.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his words the King rose, and holding up both arms to the heavens,
      implored the Sun to give the signal for the sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clouds of pungent incense rose from the burners, and gradually hid from
      view the azure disc overhead. The mammaconas who were to die, obeying the
      ritual, ran forward to the King&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We implore you, O King, to stop all the smokes of the earth. They hide
      his face, and the Sun cannot give the signal for the sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from the figure on the golden pyramid, the burners were
      extinguished, and the spot of blue gradually reappeared. The Guardians of
      the Temple, by the pyres, held in their hands metal mirrors, drawing the
      sun to a little heap of cotton in the center of each resinous pile. Thus
      did the god, of his own will, give the signal for the sacrifice! There
      were no stakes on the pyres, no chains; the victims must die willingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the throng about them chanted prayers, the two mammaconas watched
      the pyres. They feared that the god might reject them; then they would
      live, shunned by all, until they disappeared. Their eyes, large with hope
      in the mercy of the divinity, anxiously awaited the first flicker of
      flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the pyre destined to the thousand-year-old Coya did not take fire, it
      did not mean that the new one was distasteful to the god. It meant merely
      that the old one had not known how to please him, that she was not worthy
      of the sepulcher of fire, and that her body must be thrown to the black
      vultures in the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day, the first pyre to blaze up was that of the long-dead Coya.
      She was waiting. Songs rang out in her honor, and a purple veil which Dick
      had not yet noticed fell to the ground. A black gap showed in the wall,
      and in it could be seen the shadowy figure of the thousand-year-old queen,
      stiff in her scented wrappings.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ick&rsquo;s head swam.
      There, before him, was the narrow tomb into which Maria-Teresa would be
      plunged living. But was she still living? She must have died when the
      child was torn from her arms, or when she had heard his terrible cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests had lifted the dead Coya from her tomb, and carried her to the
      pyre. She sat severely erect, as Coyas should sit, even when slowly done
      to death in a living tomb. So she must sit, and that is why the tomb is
      made so narrow that she can only remain motionless on her throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erect and calm, she vanished in the flames of the pyre, while the two
      living mammaconas watched her enviously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick did not even glance at the pyres. His eyes were fixed on the hole in
      the wall. She could not live long in there, and they must lose no time if
      she was to be saved. One hand gripped Orellana&rsquo;s pick, while the other,
      armed with a revolver, still hesitated. Perhaps Maria-Teresa was not dead
      yet! But, if so why did she not open her eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the two other pyres did not take fire, and the mammaconas prayed
      passionately to the Sun. They must die before Maria-Teresa, to prepare her
      chamber in the Enchanted Realms of the Sun, and if they did not hasten
      they would never reach them first. &ldquo;Have pity, O Sun! Send us your flames,
      Ejma of the Heavens! We are women; give us courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have pity! Send us your flames!&rdquo; chanted the throng in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Sun did not send his flame until the first pyre had nearly died
      down, its end hastened by the perfumes heavy with spirit which the Guards
      of the Sacrifice poured over the blazing logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping their festive garments from them, the two mammaconas ran to the
      pyres with cries of joy, and waited, their eyes turned heavenwards in
      ecstasy. Diabolical music burst out about them, and a savage frenzy seemed
      to seize the other mammaconas as they whirled round the fires. The greedy
      flames climbed upwards and reached the victims. One of them leapt down
      with a terrible cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to the flames! Return to the flames!&rdquo; chanted the others,
      surrounding her. She writhed on the ground, calling for the knife, and a
      Guardian of the Temple went toward her. The black veils of the mammaconas
      were spotted with blood, but they danced on, singing. The hideous dwarfs
      lifted up a body, which disappeared in the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other mammacona, heroically erect, had cried out only once, and when
      she in her turn vanished in the scarlet chariot which the Sun had sent to
      take her to his Enchanted Realms, hymns of glory thundered through the
      temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maddened by the songs, the flames, the incense, and the acrid smoke of the
      pyres, three more mammaconas followed their sisters. It is impossible to
      guess how far this delirium of sacrifice would have gone had not Huascar
      stopped it. At a sign from him, the diabolical music ceased, and the
      Guardians of the Temple choked the glowing pyres with sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s turn. Dick, half fainting, opened his eyes again at
      Orellana&rsquo;s words. He saw the mammaconas strip her of the jewels with which
      she was literally covered from head to foot. From her hair, ears, cheeks,
      breast, shoulders, from her beautiful arms and shapely ankles, the &ldquo;tears
      of the Sun&rdquo; fell one by one, and were placed preciously in a golden basin.
      Last of all they removed the fatal Golden Sun bracelet All these jewels
      were to be hidden again until the day, ten years thence, when the Inca
      would demand another bride for the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was rapidly divested of her golden sheath as well, Maria-Teresa
      appeared swathed in bands of soft material. Her eyes were closed, and
      externally at all events, she was already a mummy. Her arms were bound to
      her sides, and all that remained to be done was to lift her into her tomb.
      Dick&rsquo;s eyes did not leave what could still be seen of the beloved face
      under the bands of perfumed linen which bound her chin and forehead. Her
      lips were parted, but motionless, as if she had just breathed her last
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he told himself that she must be dead. It was better so, for then
      she could not feel the hands of the horrible Guardians of the Temple lift
      her to the death-throne and then slide her into the hole where she was to
      wait a thousand years before being burned in her turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the rays of the Sun, as if to make a golden ladder for the
      woman whom the Incas, in their cruel piety, were sending to his realms,
      fell on Maria-Teresa, and lit up the narrow tomb, so that Dick saw every
      detail of the atrocious ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three porphyry slabs, fitting perfectly one into the other, had now to
      be adjusted, and the tomb would be closed. It was done in
      terrible-silence, and all eyes were fixed on workers and victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bending under its weight, the Guardians of the Temple slipped the first
      into position, hiding Maria-Teresa up to the knees. The second, brought to
      the right level on a rolling platform, covered her to the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that could now be seen was her head, swathed and bound up for the
      thousand-year sleep, with a face that was that of a dead woman. Then a
      shiver ran through the throng, though it had witnessed the sacred horrors
      preceding it without a quiver. Maria-Teresa had opened her eyes....
    </p>
    <p>
      They had opened wide and stared out from the depths of the tomb which was
      closing on her. They were terribly living, terribly wide open, staring,
      staring, at all she would see of life before the eternal Shadow took her
      to its bosom. And those eyes traveled slowly over the throng in gala
      attire which was there to see her die, then rested for the last time on
      the golden sunlight, on the beautiful light of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The superhuman agony forced those eyes even wider, those eyes which were
      never to see again. Her lips moved, as if about to utter a supreme cry of
      appeal to life, a cry of horror at the living night of the tomb. Then they
      closed again on a poor, weak little groan, while the last slab blotted out
      the look of those great eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She belonged to the god now.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>uascar raised his
      hand, and the temple began to empty in silence. There was not a song, not
      a murmur, only the slip of innumerable sandals on the stone slabs of the
      floor. Huascar and his priests, the nobles, young men, virgins, curacas
      and mammaconas crossed the threshold of the golden doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huayna Capac Runtu had descended from his throne and taken his seat beside
      the dead King, on the seat left vacant by Maria-Teresa; the Red Ponchos
      lifted the two monarchs, the dead, and the living, to their shoulders, and
      in their turn vanished into the Corridor of Night.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained in the hall only the Guardians of the Temple and the ashes
      of the first victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the three gnomes closed the doors to carry out their horrible
      duties in peace than a shadow rose up before them. Squeaking with terror,
      they fled into the Chapel of the Moon, but vengeance followed them there,
      and it was at the foot of its altar that they were shot down like
      loathsome beasts. White as Maria-Teresa had been, but icy-cool in the
      moment of action, Dick fired only one shot into each hideous skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned and ran into the temple, where Orellana was already raining
      blows on the tomb with his pick. Dick wrenched the tool from his hands,
      and set to work. But the stones did not move. His forehead covered with
      icy perspiration, he forced himself to think, to reason, trying to forget
      Maria-Teresa in her tomb and bring his engineer&rsquo;s knowledge to bear on the
      problem. Those stones could not be very heavy. Orellana and he could lift
      them easily if the three dwarfs could. They were evidently made light so
      that they could be readily removed by the priests at certain ceremonies.
      But what, was their secret? What was their secret?
    </p>
    <p>
      Quelling the moral storm that would have sent him raging impotently
      against this rampart, he compelled himself to look for the jointing of the
      stones. His hands were trembling, so he stopped for a minute to control
      himself, and then tried again. Again he failed. How were they moved?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seen them put back into position before his eyes, so there <i>must</i>
      be a way. But where was he to press, where strike? And meanwhile
      Maria-Teresa was dying behind those stones! Dying!
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he raised the pick, whirled it over his head, and struck at random,
      on the left side of the stone. Every ounce of his strength, doubled by
      despair, had been put into that blow, and the slab turned slightly on
      itself, to the right. The socket in which the stones rested was so made
      that they could swing and slip out of their frame on that side.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shout of triumph, he swung the pick over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa! Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind him, the madman was calling too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria Cristina! Maria Cristina!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick was still raining blows on the slab. Soon it had turned so far that
      he could catch hold of it with his hands, and tore them in a vain effort
      to hasten. With the handle of the pick he pushed on the left again, and
      the stone came half out of its socket.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, both he and Orellana could get firm hold and put their strength
      into it. The stone yielded, came toward them. &ldquo;Maria-Teresa!
      Maria-Teresa!&rdquo; One more effort and she would be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prodigious heave, a struggle with teeth set and breath whistling, and
      the slab came away altogether, thundered on the floor as Dick hurled it
      from off his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer from the tightly-bound head dimly visible in the
      darkness. He leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God. It&rsquo;s not Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>urning from the
      century-dead Coya with an inarticulate cry of rage, Dick seized Orellana
      by the throat as if he would have strangled the poor madman, who had
      started work on the wrong tomb. And he, thrice accursed fool that he was,
      had followed the madman&rsquo;s lead, made a mistake when every minute might
      mean Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s life!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, which was it? The tomb on the right or that on the left? Or
      neither?
    </p>
    <p>
      Loosing the old man, he controlled himself again by a superhuman effort
      and looked round the temple. No, there could be no mistake this time. It
      must be the one on the right. He looked for the angle from their
      hiding-place to the altar. Yes, this was the one!
    </p>
    <p>
      The pick thundered on another slab, while Orellana, a raving maniac now,
      danced and gibbered behind him, grunting with every blow as if he himself
      had delivered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the stone turned.... It moved... slid into their arms... fell to
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa! It is I, Dick! For God&rsquo;s sake, speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he bent oyer the rigid face of a long-forgotten Coya.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick fell to the ground as if stunned. But Orellana was already at work
      again, setting him the example, and the young engineer was on his feet in
      a moment. It must be that other one on the left, then! Once again he
      wrenched the pick from the old man&rsquo;s feeble hands and hammered on the
      granite.... The minutes are flying... flying. And She may be dying behind
      that slab, struggling for breath!... The thunder of blows echoed through
      the hall... the stone moved... slipped... fell.... At last.... No!...
      Another dead woman.... Another, another!... Not Maria-Teresa!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria Cristina! My daughter! Dearest, I am coming! Your father is here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Dick staggered to the wall, staring before him with blind eyes, the
      old man, peering into the tomb, had recognized his child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria Cristina! Dearest! Wait, wait! Only one more stone, and you will be
      out of your prison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sobbing and laughing in turn, Orellana worked desperately, finding the
      strength of his youth anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Dick fell on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me that pick. You&rsquo;re wasting time on a dead woman. Give it to me, I
      say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a terrible struggle between the two, and Dick, triumphant,
      whirled the tool over his head at another tomb, while Orellana, by the
      last effort of his life, tore the second stone from its socket, drew the
      dead body of his daughter to him and covered it with kisses and tears. Old
      madman and dead girl fell to the floor together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orellana was dead, but he had found his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick saw and heard nothing. Another tomb open... and another dead Coya of
      long ago.... The gods of the Temple of Death were ready to give up their
      dead, but not the living bride....
    </p>
    <p>
      Crying, calling, driving his nails into his bleeding palms; ready to offer
      himself up to the ferocious spirit that guarded those tombs, Dick
      staggered, fell, and got up again, dragging behind him the pick, which he
      no longer knew where to use, striving to reason and understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing here to help him! His eyes wandered hopelessly round the
      circular temple, trying to find a guiding point. Nothing! Perhaps chance
      would give him what his reasoning had failed to secure.... Yes, that was
      it... why not try here?... It might be this tomb as well as any other....
      He set to work again, but heavily... oh, so heavily... and the pick
      weighed down his hands terribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Exhausted, he dropped it.... He could do no more.... And she was
      dying... dying... while the dead, torn from their eternal sleep, stared
      back at him with unseeing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many hours had he been toiling? He did not know. The oblique rays of
      the sun had gradually risen on the walls, then vanished. Then the light
      which succeeded them faded in its turn.... Twilight had fallen... then
      darkness had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretched out on the altar steps, whither he had dragged himself with his
      last remaining strength, he closed his eyes and waited... waited for sleep
      or death. What did it matter, since Maria-Teresa was dead?

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne morning, as the
      little steamboat which runs between the Island of Titicaca and the
      mainland, was plowing its way through the waters of the lake, it was
      hailed by a tall Quichua Indian, standing upright in his pirogue. In the
      bottom of the frail craft lay a white man, and the captain, seeing the
      prostrate figure, hove to for a moment to pick it up. Thus did Dick
      Montgomery return to civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the passengers of the <i>Yavari</i> was a good-hearted alpaca
      merchant of Punho who took pity on the fever-stricken stranger and had him
      removed to his own home, where the whole household devoted itself to
      nursing the young man back to life. The Indian who brought him to the
      steamer explained that he had found the stranger, probably some tourist,
      unconscious among the ruins of the sacred island. He had therefore dosed
      him with pink water for the fever, and had brought him back to people of
      his own race. The Indian refused all reward, and the captain was the more
      surprised at this when, on searching Dick, he found a considerable sum of
      money in his pockets. For a Quichua not to strip a helpless man was indeed
      remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dick had sufficiently recovered to understand what was being said, he
      immediately recognized the Indian described to him as Huascar. In his
      quality as high-priest, Huascar had probably returned to the temple late
      at night, and had there found Dick, surrounded by gaping tombs, and the
      corpses of Orellana and the three Guardians of the Temple. Coldly
      calculating in his hatred, the Indian had decided to inflict the worst
      possible torture on Dick, leaving him to live after the death of
      Maria-Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      That torture would not last long, the young man decided. The idea that he
      might have saved Maria-Teresa had he not lost his head, and that her death
      lay at his door, tormented him without ceasing. He realized that he would
      never be able to free himself of this obsession and that it would finally
      drive him mad. Better to end it all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only he did not wish to die among these awful mountains, mute witnesses of
      the horrors that had cost him his self-respect and happiness. The
      Maria-Teresa who was constantly before his mind&rsquo;s eye was not the terrible
      mummy-like figure he had last seen, but the dainty silhouette in the
      homely surroundings of the office at Callao, among the big green
      registers, where they had met again after so long an absence and where
      they had exchanged words of love. He would go there to rejoin her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once this decision was taken, he grew rapidly better, and one day, after
      warmly thanking his host and showering presents on the whole family, he
      took the train to Mollendo, where he would join some ship for Callao. The
      voyage seemed an interminable one. At Arequipa, he visited the little
      adobe house by the rio de Chili, and thought of the vain appeal they had
      made to that scoundrel Garcia. There also, for the first time since his
      illness, he thought of his traveling companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had happened to Uncle Francis, Don Christobal and Natividad? Perhaps
      their bones were then bleaching in some inaccessible corner of the
      Corridors of Night. The Marquis, at all events, had not endured the
      torture of impotently witnessing the murder of his two children.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dick reached Mollendo there was a howling gale on, but he at once
      went down to the harbor. It was deserted save for two shadows, which
      rushed toward him with cries of joy. Yes, they were alive and breathing:&mdash;Uncle
      Francis and Natividad! Though white and sad-looking, they did not seem to
      have suffered a great deal. Dick clasped their hands, and they, seeing him
      so pale and thin, said no word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they walked along for a few minutes, deep in thoughts. At last
      Mr. Montgomery turned to his nephew:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened to Don Christobal? Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he was with you.&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s voice was toneless, detached from all
      things of this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only then that Natividad, without being asked, explained how he and
      Uncle Francis, after the frustrated attempt in the House of the Serpent,
      had been thrown into a dungeon in which they passed four days, and in
      which the illustrious scientist had at last become convinced of the
      reality of their adventure. At the end of those four days, finding the
      prison doors open and unguarded, they had fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently all the Indians were bolting to the mountains from Cuzco, and
      the explanation for this they had found on reaching Sicuani. President
      Veintemilla, risking his all on one bold stroke, had surprised Garcia&rsquo;s
      forces in the middle of the Interaymi fêtes, and the four squadrons of his
      escort which remained faithful had cut up and routed the thousands of
      Quichua riflemen. Barely five hundred in all, but of Spanish blood, they
      had repeated Pizarro&rsquo;s exploit on those same plains of Xauxa, while the
      same ancient walls, with the impassability of immortal things, again
      stared down on the struggle of the races.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia had escaped over the Bolivian frontier, and was on the point of
      blowing out his brains when he heard of a revolution in Paraguay which
      made life worth living again. So he crossed into Paraguay with his lawless
      &ldquo;cabinet,&rdquo; to the great satisfaction of the President of Bolivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prom Sicuani, Uncle Francis and Natividad had gone straight to Mollendo,
      hoping to find the Marquis there, if the new fortunes of the republic had
      also opened the doors of his prison. As to Dick, they had not expected to
      see him until Lima, &ldquo;after he had done everything to save Maria-Teresa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that they had pronounced her name before him, and
      Dick saw a very real and very great sympathy in their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is dead,&rdquo; he said, gripping his uncle&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They paced up and down again, silently, before the raging breakers of the
      Pacific, which had already kept two of them prisoners in Mollendo for the
      past ten days. Dick would not say another word, and his companions,
      ignorant of what had happened, could not even try to give him hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight more days passed by, and the elements still held them prisoners at
      Mollendo. His uncle and Natividad watched Dick closely, but his outward
      calm finally dispelled their fears, and once aboard a ship for Callao,
      they even questioned him. He told them what he had seen in the Temple of
      Death, while they listened in horror to the simply-worded narrative, made
      in a singularly quiet voice. Afterwards, Uncle Francis locked himself in
      his cabin and sat for a long time with his head between his hands, staring
      at an unopened note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick, leaning over the ship&rsquo;s side, was now gazing idly at the rapidly
      approaching coast on which he had landed with so much hope and joy. The
      Peru of Pizarro and the Incas, the fabulous land of gold and legends, the
      Eldorado of his young ambition and of his love! Dead were his love and his
      ambition. There lived only the legends, at which they had laughed, which
      had killed all their dreams and which was to kill him after sending
      Maria-Teresa to a living tomb! And they had laughed, laughed at the
      warning of those two stately old ladies, Velasquez canvases brought to
      life and striving to retain all their pictorial dignity!
    </p>
    <p>
      As on that first day, he was the first man off the liner, dropping over
      the side into the swaying craft of a noisy boatman. This time, though, he
      did not need to ask where the Galle de Lima lay, and his eyes hardly left
      the part of the city to which he had hastened so full of hope, where
      Maria-Teresa had waited for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not hurry on reaching land. Walking slowly he entered the network
      of tortuous streets, passed through the labyrinth of alleys, and finally
      reached the point whence he could see the verandah.... There he had come
      to greet her every night, there he had come one night to find her gone.
      Never again would he see that dear face, that dainty figure bent over the
      big green books, while the slim fingers toyed with a golden pencil
      attached to her supple waist with a long gold chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Dick stopped, staggered, and put his hand to his side with a
      choking intake of breath.... It hurt, that hallucinating apparition on the
      verandah.... Or perhaps it is true that the shades of the dear departed
      come back to people the spots they loved best, that they have the power of
      showing themselves to those they loved.... For Maria-Teresa is there,
      leaning out as she used to, turning her sweet face as she used to.... How
      pale she is, how diaphanous; her well-remembered gestures are no more than
      the ghosts of those gestures!...
    </p>
    <p>
      He hardly dared breathe, fearing that the vision would vanish at the sound
      of his voice-... He advanced cautiously, stealthily, like a child stalking
      a butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They are in each other&rsquo;s arms. The cry which has come from those pale lips
      is a living one. They clung to each other, trembling, laughing, crying,
      and would have fallen in their weakness had not other shadows come to
      their aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Agnes and her duenna, Irene, held up Maria-Teresa, while Don
      Christobal, running out into the street, caught the young engineer under
      the arm, and led him slowly in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Christobal, dancing at the door of the office, shouted with glee
      and clapped his hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you so, Maria-Teresa! I told you he wasn&rsquo;t dead!... Now you&rsquo;ll get
      better, Maria-Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria-Teresa, in Dick&rsquo;s arms again, was sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would come back here if you were still alive.... But is it
      really you, Dick?... Really you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maria-Teresa has been awfully ill,&rdquo; explained the child, while the two
      old ladies cried. &ldquo;But we cured her by telling her you were <i>not</i>
      dead. Of course I <i>knew</i> Huascar had saved you too.... Huascar saved
      us all, you know.... He took us away from all those nasty Indians.... And
      father said that we should all be dead but for him. Didn&rsquo;t you, Father?...
      But now you mustn&rsquo;t die any more, must you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there, Maria-Teresa. I saw them put you into the tomb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>were</i> there, then! I knew it. I felt your eyes on mine, and
      that&rsquo;s why I looked. I knew you were watching... somewhere.... When they
      took Christobal away from me I thought I should die... Huascar had told me
      he would be quite safe, but I couldn&rsquo;t believe it.... Then that horrible
      cry!... I didn&rsquo;t open my eyes again until I felt yours on them.... I knew
      you were there, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two old ladies and the Marquis were making desperate signs to him, and
      Dick tried to stop her, but she went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t leave me there to die, and so I waited, waited.... It
      was terribly long.... And then I began to choke.... I couldn&rsquo;t move; only
      sit there and wait... What does it matter, Father, now that we&rsquo;re all
      alive and happy?... Then I heard somebody thundering blows on the wall,
      and thought you were coming.... Only just in time, for I was choking....
      There was such funny music in my ears.... Then I heard the stone torn
      away, and felt myself being lifted out.... When I opened my eyes, Dick, it
      was not you, but Huascar.... He carried me into a dark little room, with
      a torch burning in it, and untied my arms and head.... Then he slipped on
      that horrible bat-skin dress again.... I couldn&rsquo;t believe I was saved,
      though he told me so....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a moment, choking, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left me where I was, and started working. First he lifted a mummy into
      my place. &lsquo;There is no sacrilege,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for the god now has the
      number of wives he needs.&rsquo;... He had evidently prepared everything, and
      dug an opening as deep into the back of my tomb as he dared.... I was
      horribly afraid, because he said he had done it all for love of me... and
      I screamed when he tried to pick me up.... I was ever so much more afraid
      than in the tomb.... He laughed, and said I was lucky to have had him for
      a friend.... You, he said, had nearly spoiled his plans, and he had had to
      trap you all to save me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I told him that he had only saved me for a worse fate, he laughed
      again.... Then he picked me up, for I was too weak to move, and carried me
      miles and miles through the darkness.... When he stopped, it was before a
      low door.... He pushed it open, and there were father and Christobal....
      While they were kissing me, Huascar went to the door.... He looked
      awful.... Then he said to father: &lsquo;Señor, I promised to return your son
      and daughter to you. Here they both are. You will find nothing to prevent
      your departure. An Inca, señor, never breaks his word.&rsquo;... We have not
      seen him since.... I had to tell you, Dick, so that if ever you meet that
      man again, you will know what we owe him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At her last words, the young engineer shivered and pressed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He need not be afraid. I remember what I owe him. He saved both of you
      and us, dear, and I promised him that if he saved you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know! Father has told me....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He considered: your promise an insult,&rdquo; interrupted the Marquis. &ldquo;After
      my capture, they took me to the Island, and he came to see me in my
      dungeon. I thought my last hour had come, and did not spare him with my
      tongue. He let me finish, and then explained what he had done, his whole
      plan of action. When Maria-Teresa and Christobal were brought to me, the
      two Indians guarding my door, who were his absolute slaves, would take us
      both to the mainland in a pirogue. He told me, too, of your interview at
      Arequipa, and gave me a message for you. Here it is:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tell that young man, whom I do not know, that the señorita will be as
      free as her heart, which is mine neither to take, to buy nor to sell. He
      must know that. I have done him no harm, and he has insulted me. I forgive
      him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, as he was about to go, he turned again:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not thank me, señor. Thank the one who is now in heaven, and who was
      the señora de la Torre. I ask for only one thing in exchange for my
      services, and that is for you never to speak of them. The memory of the
      High Priest of the Incas must not be dishonored.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Huascar&rsquo;s message, Dick. There is no reason why you should not
      marry Maria-Teresa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Uncle Francis and Natividad dashed into the room. On their
      way from the harbor, they had learned of the Marquis&rsquo; miraculous return to
      Lima with his two children, and hearing that the whole family had come to
      Callao that day&mdash;Maria-Teresa to see her dear old office for the last
      time!&mdash;they had come there running. Aunt Agnes and Irene, anxious for
      their charge&rsquo;s health, would have taken her away, but the young girl
      insisted that this storm of still shaky laughter and interjections was the
      best medicine for her malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a bad dream,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is how we must take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Christobal took up the cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I have had a long talk with Veintemilla, and that is the way he
      asks us to treat it, for patriotic reasons. In exchange, he has promised
      to help me wind up the business here and sell our concessions. Dick and
      Maria-Teresa will be married in England, if nobody objects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natividad alone had objections to make, and waved his arms disconsolately
      above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same old story!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;If I had my way, we should soon get to
      the bottom of those Corridor of Night mysteries.... But no!... the same
      old game of shut your eyes and see nothing.... Here&rsquo;s Veintemilla now,
      instead of settling with those Indians once and for all, asking us to call
      it a bad dream!... Bad dream indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Natividad,&rdquo; said the Marquis. &ldquo;I fear you are a troublous spirit.
      By the way, I have sad news for you. You are no longer inspector superior
      of Callao.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natividad fell into a chair, his mouth wide open, struggling for words to
      qualify the airy attitude of this man, for whom he had risked everything.
      He was so comical that they all burst into laughter, while the little old
      gentleman, purple with fury, strode toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so quick, Natividad, not so quick!&rdquo; called the Marquis after him.
      &ldquo;There is also some good news for you. You have been appointed inspector
      superior at Lima.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Natividad fell into a chair, but beaming, stuttering with joy and
      gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dream.... the dream of my life.... I might have been dead though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The appointment, which I saw President Veintemilla sign, is, of course,
      only valid in the event of your being living,&rdquo; smiled the Marquis. &ldquo;As
      those Indians of yours haven&rsquo;t eaten you alive, you can keep an eye on
      them again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! We must not talk about it,&rdquo; replied Natividad, the magistrate&rsquo;s
      toga weighing on his shoulders again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And neither shall we,&rdquo; whispered Dick, bending over Maria-Teresa&rsquo;s pale
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded slowly. &ldquo;Do you know, Dick, looking round me and seeing the
      same old chairs and books again, the same dear faces, and when I think of
      the Temple of Death, it really does only seem like an ugly dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natividad, having said good-by to all, was talking to the Marquis by the
      door. He opened it and fell back with a muffled exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A corpse, until then held upright by the closed door, fell into the room.
      Maria-Teresa, first to realize what it was, fell on her knees beside the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Huascar, whom she had driven out of that door and who had dragged
      himself there to die, a dagger in his heart.

    <h2>
      EPILOGUE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his story must
      have an epilogue, for I have not yet had occasion to speak again of Oviedo
      Runtu, bank-clerk and last King of the Incas. After a thousand adventures
      in the Andes, which I may describe to you some day, Oviedo Runtu and his
      lieutenants in the revolt with Garcia were tracked down by Natividad&rsquo;s
      police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oviedo Runtu surrendered and saved his life by promising to quench the
      last embers of revolt. Tried by court-martial, he was sentenced to
      perpetual exile, but Natividad subsequently interceded and obtained his
      pardon. It was, moreover, the new Chief of Police of Lima who secured him
      a post at Punho, in a branch of the Franco-Belgian bank. There Natividad
      could watch him, and finally convinced himself that the bank-clerk King
      did nothing to resuscitate the marvelous fêtes of the Interaymi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oviedo Runtu died very prosaically, after marrying a lady of Lima who had
      made the trip to Lake Titicaca specially to see the last King of the
      Incas. Of that journey was born a romance, and in after years travelers
      passing through Punho would have the royal couple pointed out to them.
      They were always very much amused when they heard that the King, working
      daily in a bank, earned just one hundred&rsquo; and fifty soles a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when some charitable souls were chaffing the King&rsquo;s widow about
      the mediocre state in which she lived, the Coya, as she was derisively
      called, retorted that had she and her husband so wished, they could have
      been the wealthiest couple on earth. But the treasures of the Incas, she
      added, belonged to the gods and the dead, and none might touch them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asked if she had ever seen those treasures, the Coya asserted that her
      husband had shown them to her once, and she told fabulous stories of the
      riches hidden in the Temple of Death. * Naturally, nobody believed her.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The anonymous author of the MS. &ldquo;<i>Antiy y monumentos del
     Peru</i>&rdquo; says:&mdash;

     &ldquo;It Is widely known, and generally admitted, that there
     exists in the ancient fortress of the Cuzco a secret room In
     which is hidden a vast treasure, consisting chiefly of
     golden statues of all the Incas. A lady who has been in this
     room is still living. This is Doña Maria de Esquivel, wife
     of the last Inca. I have heard her tell how she was taken
     there.

     &ldquo;Don Carlos, husband of this lady, did not live in a manner
     suited to his rank, and she often upbraided him, saying that
     she had been cozened into marrying a poor Indian under the
     pompous style of &lsquo;Lord of the Incas.9 She said this so often
     that Don Carlos grew angry, and one day retorted: &lsquo;Madam, I
     will show you whether I am rich or poor. Too will see that
     no lord, no monarch on this earth, has a greater treasure
     than I.&rsquo; Taking her to the ruined fortress, he bound her
     eyes, and led her only a few steps before removing the
     bandage again.

     &ldquo;She was in a great quadrangular hall, and ranged all about
     it were the statues of the Incas, each about the size of a
     twelve-year-old child, and all of massive gold. She saw also
     many vases of gold and silver, the whole making one of the
     most magnificent treasures in the world.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Even so, none believed the soldiers of Pizarro when they said that in Peru
      their horses had been shod with silver!

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
